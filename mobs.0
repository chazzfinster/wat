he can be seen organizing the store.

a short, chubby man~
A short, chubby man with a noticeable paunch lounges about lazily.~
   Behind the desk, there resides a short, chubby man with a 
noticeable paunch and rounded, almost boyish looking features. 
He wears his hair cut to a medium length, brushed back from his 
face to settle in neat, oiled waves. He has close set, dark blue 
eyes and a small, somewhat flattened nose. Chubby jowls frame 
his wide, pouting mouth, and his rounded, pudgy chin has a slight 
cleft. His hands are unmarred by both scars and callus, and he 
gives off a faint scent of fine perfume.

A dark-skinned, well-muscled man sells armour here.~
   Resting upon a stool behind the counter is a dark-skinned man 
with a well-muscled frame. Wiry, ropy muscles adorn his arms, 
which each have one long, pale, and thin scar cutting from elbow 
to wrist. His hands are thick and calloused, with the faintly 
rubberlike scars of a victim of fire lining his knuckles and 
backhand. His torso and midsection are scarless and smooth, with 
well defined muscles stretching beneath the skin. He has 
well-developed legs, the sort with power and endurance. His head 
is bald and shines like polished ebony, his pate covered with an 
intricately detailed white-inked tattoo that resembles a crown of 
claws. Large and bushy white eyebrows perch atop a set of large, 
seeking eyes the color of slate grey. His boldly shaped nose 
juts out with stature. His whole face has the tanned nature of 
one who spends much time in the sun, with smiling, patronly 
wrinkles framing the mouth and eyes, although he seems otherwise 
young.

a short, dark-haired man~
A short, dark-haired man adjusts weapons here.~
   Standing slightly shorter than average for his race, this 
human male's dark hair is long and combed into a semblance of 
neatness, bound back from his face. Curling at the ends, the 
sorrel locks form a loose tail that just covers the back of his 
neck. His skin is a pale olive hue, with the undertones common 
to many that pervade the land. His figure is lithe and slender, 
and has veered away from a powerful musculature and developed 
into the graces that would gift the body of a dancer. His face 
is angular and dark-browed, his dark grey-green eyes shaded by 
the shadows there. His nose is long and thin with a slightly 
curved tip that ends just above the soft flesh of his slim lips.

A tall woman with dark hair and grey eyes stands here.~
   A bit of maturity shows on this woman's face, evident with the 
smile lines about her eyes. Despite that, her grey eyes are 
youthful and bright beneath thick bangs. She is tall, though 
admittedly a bit plump for her size, hips easily rounding down to 
her legs and well-proportioned elsewhere. Her skin holds a 
darkish color, obviously tanned, and her arms show an unusual 
musculature for a woman of her size.

A scrawny person with child-like features huddles here.~
Standing perhaps four and a half feet tall, this person isn't 
much more than skin and bones. Their face is small, fair-featured
and child-like. Eyes that are proportionately bigger than their
head, a cool smoky blue, peer out from under a tangled mass of
blond hair. Tiny arms and legs sprout from a skeletel torso,
body unwashed and caked with dirt and grime.

lunar authority tech mechanically-armed HOLMES~
A mechanically-armed Lunar Authority tech~
A mechanically-armed Lunar Authority tech works here lazily.~
   The most distinctive feature of this middle-aged tech is his 
mechanically-replaced left arm. Far from a normal cybernetic, 
this piece of machinery seems literally modular, the hand 
detachable and replaceable with all manner of useful tools. 
Beyond that eye-catching bit of technology, this man is rather 
plain. Of a broad build that suggests little labor, even in the 
low gravity of Luna, his pale complexion denotes a fellow that 
rarely sees the light, artificial or otherwise. Garbed in a 
simple sort of jumpsuit, the man is constantly accompanied by a 
sturdy case, bearing his hand replacements. He currently wears 
hand number one, a fascimile of the real thing.

Jill limp lifeless humanoid sickening arachnid~
a limp, lifeless humanoid suspended upon sickening, huge arachnid legs~
A limp, lifeless humanoid suspended upon sickening, huge arachnid legs looms here.~
   Hanging from eight tremendous, sickening black and segmented 
legs is a gaunt and lifeless body, what was possibly a human at 
one point. The legs jut out from black lumps of flesh along the 
corpse's spine, and from what was once the stomach hangs a fleshy 
sac, filled and sloshing with something within. The only part of 
the human body that doesn't simply hang is the remant of the 
head, which is held up by a dark growth on the back of the neck. 
Peering out are black, endless eyes, yet nothing beneath remains, 
aside from a drooping tongue from where the mouth used to be.

A frumpy little thing fluffs about here.~
   This thing is just like, a little ball of...frump. And maybe 
some fluff thrown in there. It is solid white in color, save for 
two beady little black eyes. All other features or limbs or 
anything else are hidden beneath the frump.

Guardian Rock roll xAdmintraining xHeadbanger~
The Guardian of rock and roll~
The Guardian stands here, a bloody big sword held vertically in its hands.~
   Vast is this thing, biggly big is the bigness of this big creature. It is 
still and unmoving for the most part, composed of articulated metal joints like 
armor of old. A pair of braced legs planted shoulder width apart and a 
reversed feet give the figure an erect and strong carriage. It's torso, far to 
lean and narrow to provide any sort of rigid support to its endeavors takes up 
the lions share of its build. And finally, at the upper most reaches, a 
shadowed visage. Sutured in to the very grey flesh of the creature is coarse 
cloth, providing a masking off its entire features. From shoulders to brow.

jaunty white blood cell~
a jaunty white blood cell~
A jaunty white blood cell is here, fighting against the current of bloodflow.~
   Snowy white in hue, this small cell bears certain tufts and peaks going 
every which way. It is bolstered upward with no visible legs in sight, though 
tiny flagella do beat upon its surface. A mouth resides, somewhere amid all 
the surface formations. It hangs open, found frequently in a goofy smile, with 
a pale rose-hued tongue hanging out of the side.

a large, black beetle~
A large, matte-black beetle is here, mandibles clicking.~
   This beetle is quite large, with the apex of its shell rising above four 
feet in height. It head is at least a foot long, with wicked mandibles 
protruding further in jagged hooks. Its chitinous covering is scored in many 
places, showing its survival through many battles. It moves in short, quick 
movements, scanning the area intently.

a spiral-shaped pathogen~
A pathogen lingers here, its long body shaped in a spiral formation.~
   With colors ranging from blue to green to orange to red, this 
spiral-patterned organism bears many wicked spikes shooting off in every 
direction. Amid the spikes are several gaping mouths, ready to attack any 
creature it happens to come across. Without arms or legs, it appears immobile 
but for the flagella that dance at the end of nearly ever spike, allowing it to 
wade in place against the heavy current of bloodflow.

a fluffy white kitten with vicious fangs~
A fluffy white kitten with vicious fangs stalks around here.~
   Fluffy and pristine white fur encases this adorable, well-groomed feline 
from her small head to her slender, lengthy tail. Her slanted eyes are a 
striking olive-green and disarmingly large. Within her mouth are three rows of 
razor sharp teeth, similar to shark teeth and with no practical or scientific 
explanation of how they do not cause her a visible, external malformation on 
her face. Two dangerous looking fangs jut down to hang several centimeters 
below her chin, still dripping from what appears to be blood. An elegant black 
collar is clasped around her neck with the small diamond-shaped tag reading, 
"Skepsis".

A robotic dragon towers here, with whirring red eyes.~
   This dragon typically stands upon all four feet, robotic legs grinding 
against the floor with hardened, gleaming steel claws. The top of its back 
rests some nine feet off the ground, with an unusually large electrical jack 
protruding upward. A long tail stems from this creature, extending some eight 
feet before tapering into a gruesome spike. A long neck leads up to its head, 
which boasts whirring red eyes and an imposing jaw that bears numerous 
uncovered metal teeth.

Igor old gentleman bulging eyes incredibly long nose xxPersonaNPCxx~
an old gentleman with bulging eyes and an incredibly long nose~
An old gentleman with bulging eyes and an incredibly long nose stands here.~
   This old gentleman exudes an air of timeless immortality and limitless 
patience. Most notable about his apperance is a long nose that juts out of his 
face, nearly as long as his head itself. Second to that is his bulging eyes, 
which bare pinpoint pupils, that are somewhat bloodshot. These are framed by 
long, fuzzy black eyelashes that arch to give his lumpy head a rounder look. 
The top pasty, pale head is completely bald, though it is framed on the sides 
by shoulder length, ratty, bone-white hair. He almost seems hunchbacked, 
though on a closer inspection one could see his neck is actually just kinked 
quite far forward to make it seem like he might not have one at all. Though 
his body is average size, his arms and legs are quite thin, giving him a 
cyllandrical appearance when his arms are at his side and his legs are set 
together. His fingers are thin, bony, and long.

A segmented insectoid with $hgtquartzcolor1, $hgtquartztype0 hooks carelessly rolls here.~
   Gargantuan in width, this terrible creature stands roughly at four feet, yet 
sits five feet across. Massive rows of segmented chitin plates form at the 
brow of the fiendish creature, two deep blue eyes lie deeply imbedded in the 
armored confines as well. The chitin plates of the creature are smooth, very 
smooth and slick with goo. Elongated, rows of $hgtquartztype0 hooks line the 
underbelly of the beast, merging chitin with glowing purple $hgtquartzcolor1 
quartz.

A minuscule, black-furred field mouse scurries here.~
   Only about a couple of inches long, this tiny field mouse would be easy to 
miss by anyone not looking for it. The tiny rodent has black fur and appears 
to be a juvenile of the species. Short arms and legs remain under the tube 
like body, ending in a cone-shaped head with a small round nose and whiskers. 
The small rodent has a tail and roundish ears, sprouting from the otherwise 
unremarkable body.

a lanky, dark-haired youth~
A lanky looking youth stands here looking restless.~
   Dark brown hair is cut short around the head of this male youth with uneven 
lines and and angles. Perhaps done by a knife, the hair is not the only 
example of disarray, his appearance is marred with tiny nicks, scrapes and 
cuts. Brown eyes, matching his hair is set into his face with caverns for 
sockets. Protrusive cheek bones and a sharp chin are just some of the features 
that speak to malnutrition. Overall this boy is tall and skinny, lacking the 
appearance of health.
