a massive, black-feathered emu~
a massive, two-legged bird with black feathers and beady red eyes~
An emu is a bird about 2 metres high. It has lots of feathers and it can run fast because it has long legs. Its feathers are black, grey and purple. It's very cheeky when you tease it or steal its eggs. It will peck you when the emu catches you because it's angry.

hovercopter sleek matte black xbyBoo copter helo~
 a sleek, matte black hovercopter~
A sleek, matte black hovercopter flies over the wastes with the sound of rotors.~
   Large enough to be a personnel carrier, this matte black 
chopper is still on the smaller end of aircraft. It has a sleek 
frame with an obvious cockpit, covered by reinforced glass at the 
bullet-shaped front. With room for a number of humans, the belly 
bulges out, still held aloft by the rodlike landing gear. From 
there it tapers back into two tail wings, each with a 
perpendicular pair of flaps on the end. At each side is a large 
wing, at least half of the full length of the chopper. For more 
than just balance, these expand and encircle two huge rotors. At 
the bases of the wings, along the top, can be noted twin engines. 
Along the tail has been painted "GC" in large, white-bordered 
black letters.
