a $zombieone, $zombietwo $zombiename~
A $zombieone, $zombietwo $zombiename is here.~
   Despite the $zombieone and $zombietwo nature of this 
$zombiename, you can still recognise this person as human, 
although the vacant gaze of their fused-open eyes and slack 
hanging jaw are clear indications that they are clearly beyond 
any help. A persistent, guttural groaning issues forth from 
their ruined gullet, hands twitching often of their own accord. 
Most movements are shuffling and awkward, save the occasional 
savage gesture of speed. Strange growths and boils have broken 
out across their skin, and a heavy thumping, as if a gargantuan 
heart beat slowly, echoes from its chest.

a skinny middle-aged man with wild white hair~
A skinny middle-aged man with wild white hair is here, slightly hunched.~
   A dusting of stringy white hair covers this man's skull, 
straying haphazardly in all directions. His eyes are a rich 
brown in hue and are almond in shape, with a subtle tilt upwards 
at the outer corners. He stands at a middling height, neither 
tall or short, and his body is rather thin by design, a display 
of small bone structure. His nose is flat, his cheekbones are 
high, and the color of his skin has beige undertones. Gentle 
flecks of dirty white and brown hair create a stubbly beard that 
peppers his face and jaw completely beneath the bridge of his 
nose. His fingers are especially long and tapered, with uncut 
nails that hide a noticeable share of dirt and grime.

a brown-haired woman with deep-set eyes~
A brown-haired woman with deep-set eyes stands with her jaw set, firmly.~
   Standing tall and stick thin, this woman has a somewhat 
haunted look with her brown, deep-set eyes and yellow-hued skin 
tone. A lack of color has left her olive skin tone washed out, 
but despite her jaundiced appearance, she actually seems quite 
sturdy. Her long and tenuous limbs are steady, and her posture 
is upright. The hair crowning her head is a rather mousy shade 
of brown, and it falls quite straight and limp down to her 
shoulders.

a short young man with dark hair~
A short young man with dark hair watches on with wary eyes.~
   This young man is short in stature and slightly built, making 
him seem smaller than he actually is. Wisps of straight, dark 
brown hair hang onto his forehead and down over his ears, each 
strand unevenly shorn. His brows are heavy and thick, giving him 
a rather cloudy expression by default, despite his mood. Thin 
lips, a nondescript nose, and rounded cheeks make his face, along 
with a set of small blue eyes that are a bit close together.

a swarthy-skinned man with dark features~
A swarthy-skinned man with dark features looms here.~
   Standing tall and straight, this man has skin that is a soft 
brown hue. His pitch hair is long enough to be swept neatly 
back, but it curls at the ends by his ears and along the nape of 
the neck. His eyes are as dark as his hair, each one greatly 
defined by a dark lashline and brow. His face is cleanly cut, 
set with a straight nose and a mouth that is prone to flash white 
teeth that stand out due to the hue of his skin. His body is 
trim and his hands are long, capable, and neatly kept.

A young, blonde-haired woman with a shapely figure is here.~
   A tumble of ash-blonde hair falls to hang around this young 
woman's shoulders and down her back in a riot of waves. Her eyes 
are a light sage color in hue, the green irises touched with and 
muted by a mix of grey. Each brow is darkened and defined, and 
the features of her face are neat by design, finished with a 
generous mouth. Slender of frame, the lines of her body are 
accented by obvious feminine charms.

   This survivor wanders around with their chin tucked downward, 
casting furtive sidelong glances at other people moving past. 
Though their eyes are wary, their overall expression is rather 
blank, as if they are lost, confused, or just very much elsewhere 
in their mind. Each step is weighted and dragging, and their 
general direction is a bit off, as if they are lacking aim or 
purpose.

   This survivor is ambling along, keeping a good passing 
distance between themself and others that move by. Overall, they 
seem somewhat skittish and withdrawn, taken with their own 
thoughts. Occasionally, a passer-by will catch their attention, 
but they seem reluctant to make solid eye contact. Shuffling 
steps move them along, putting them much at pace with others that 
wander by.

A thickly-built, dark-skinned man stands here.~
   This black man is tall, broad-shouldered, and muscular. His 
head bears a thin layer of coarse hair, growing down into a chin 
strap and a small moustache. His brow slopes over two dark brown 
eyes set beneath thin eyebrows and on either side of a bulbous 
nose. His thick neck leads down to a barrel chest, and his arms 
are thickly-muscled; his dark skin seems barely able to hold his 
muscles back when he moves, and scars run all over. Overall, 
this man appears no stranger to hard work or harsh conditions.

Brittney short lean dead woman~
a short, lean dead woman~
A short, lean dead woman shambles about here, her torso twisted.~
   Short and lean, this woman has a tomboyish air. She has red 
hair, green eyes, and extremely pale skin with a scar under her 
right eye. Her face is round and her features are mousy and 
haggard - her hair is cut at the shoulders and she sports bangs 
that end at her eyebrows. Her body, while lean, is still 
muscular and fairly curvey. Her spine appears to be slightly 
twisted, causing her torso to be twisted at an odd, unnatural 
angle. Her eyes are sunken in and the color of their irises are 
pale, as though they had been blended with translucent water.

a gangly, bug-eyed man~
A gangly, bug-eyed auctioneer stands here, jingling lightly.~
   This man's head is covered in a crop of straight blonde hair, 
swept back to hand down near his thin shoulders. His forhead is 
fairly large, and his bright blue eyes are constantly wide, 
almost bugging out of his skull. His nose is short, bulbous, and 
slightly crooked, and he has a pencil-thin moustache. His jaw 
slants down to his prominent chin. The rest of him is tall and 
lanky, all knobbly bones covered in a layer of muscle.

a sienna-skinned, jet-haired young girl~
A sienna-skinned, jet-haired young girl is here.~
    This girl is young, though her age cannot be judged in certainty.
Perhaps she has seen as few as eight years, or as many as eleven. Her
dark eyes glimmer with a clarity beyond those years, however many.
Her hair is a deep, straight black, and is surprisingly well-kept.
The color of her hair is darker than would be expected of one with
her light brown skin. Her features are small save for a wide, though
otherwise average nose.

Betty Queen EGT5 black winged tentacled behemoth human facial features~
a black-winged, tentacled behemoth with human facial features~
A black-winged, tentacled behemoth with human facial features looms above.~
   Dark, nearly pitch-black chitinous exoskeleton protects the 
domed surface of this fourteen foot-long insectoid creature's 
external shell. With a body resembling a centipede's, the thorax 
segment at the rear lies parallel to the floor and is covered in 
tiny curved legs encased in the same dark chitin. The front 
portion of the body pulls up from the ground to expose 
surprisingly humanoid features etched into the silvery 
underbelly. With two small black eyes lacking irises and a 
smashed nose that rests above a small mouth, it looks like a 
small girl has become encased inside this monstrosity. The mouth 
hangs open and drools some kind of yellowish liquid. The front 
of the exposed underbelly just below its human 'face' sports 
several dozen writhing tentacles, some of them ending in sharp 
bards and others tipped with suckers. Just above the face, the 
insectoid frame comes to a rounded end with giant wing-like 
structures that descend from the back of the shell. Made of the 
same chitinous material as the shell, these small flaps seem to 
be bathed in a viscious, green substance that is secreted from a 
number of small orifices that dot the surface.

HGT2 grotesquery $hgtbuild $hgtflesh regular~
a $HGTbuild, $HGTflesh-fleshed grotesquery~
A $HGTbuild, $HGTflesh-fleshed grotesquery prowls here, drooling.~
   This $HGTbuild person has mutated to an incredible extent: 
$HGTflesh flesh hangs off of $HGTscales scales, hands have 
transformed into $HGTclaws claws, and the creature seems far 
from being recognizably "human." It prowls, drool running from a 
$HGTjaw jaw, $HGTtongue tongue lolling obscenely. Wherever 
skin isn't there is some sort of mutation and these mutations are 
covered by a $HGTlayer of $HGTliquid. Several $HGTtumor 
tumors and $HGTflavor cysts also cover the majority of its 
remaining flesh. This $HGTflavor creature has a large bulge 
dominating its upper chest, running all the way up to end at its 
goiter, the flesh ballooning grotesquely outwards. From the 
bulge comes a deep, thrumming bass - as if from a gigantic heart.

a $oneegtone, teardrop-shaped insectoid~
A $oneegtone, teardrop-shaped insectoid with a thick exoskeleton creeps nearby.~
   The nebulous mass of this insectoid creature resembles a  tumor-ridden teardrop. Its chitinous exoskeleton is made of a  shiny black substance with such a bright sheen that appears  metallic in nature. Two dangerous-looking mandibles extend from  the rounded end of the teardrop, coated in some viscous, green  substance that $oneegtone to the ground periodically. Hundreds of  singly-jointed legs of the same black chitin as the shell line  the underbelly of this creature, moving in wave-like unison  whenever it scuttles about. At the front of the underbelly, just  beneath the mandibles, a row of interlocking teeth line the maw  of the creature, which seems to track down along the spine.

DrazeNPC fibrous scarred tattooed steel man~
a fibrous, grotesquely-scarred, tattooed man with one eye~
A fibrous, tattooed, one-eyed man shambles about, grotesquely scarred.~
   Of average height and light build, this man's body is riddled 
with scars. Pockmarks and slashes cover the majority of his 
frame, and his back and left shoulder are covered in one large 
burn scar; a scar that obvious signs of skin-grafting and other 
surgeries have ultimately failed to hide. His right forearm is 
covered by a tattoo sleeve - it starts at the inside of his wrist 
with a grinning skull, a dagger stuck in its eye. The skull is 
on fire, and the flames weave up and around his arm, forming 
various patterns and pictures. The tattoo ends at his neck, the 
flames licking at his jugular. Upon his head is sat a mess of 
thick black hair, reaching just to one hazel eye, his right eye 
nothing more than a grotesque hole. His nose is crooked, as if 
broken long ago, and sits above thin lips and a squared jaw. 
Overall, this man hasn't an ounce of fat on him, his weathered 
and beaten body is muscular, though wasted slightly from unuse.

doorguard locker-room variable~
A locker-room variable doorguard is here.~
   This survivor is standing guard, keeping a good distance 
between themself and others that move by. Overall, they seem 
somewhat skittish and withdrawn, taken with their own thoughts. 
Occasionally, a passer-by will catch their attention, but they 
seem reluctant to make solid eye contact. They just go about 
their business, silently.

EGT2 insectoid large teadrop shaped regular~
a large, teardrop-shaped insectoid~
A large, teardrop-shaped insectoid with a ridged exoskeleton creeps nearby.~
   This insectoid creature resembles a tumor-ridden teardrop, 
about four to five feet long and maybe a foot and a half high, 
with a shiny, hard, black chitinous exoskeleton. There is a 
bright, metallic sheen to the shell, and it appears to be ridged. 
Two dangerous-looking mandibles extend from the rounded end of 
the teardrop, coated in some viscous, green substance that drips 
to the ground periodically. Thousands of singly-jointed legs of 
the same black chitin as the shell line the underbelly of this 
creature, moving in wave-like unison whenever it scuttles about. 
At the front of the underbelly, just beneath the mandibles, a row 
of interlocking teeth line the maw of the creature, which seems 
to track down along the spine. These teeth are long, thin, 
curved and serrated.

a $hgtIIIdescrip mass of $hgtIIIhide on a $hgtIIIsize humanoid form~
A $hgtIIIdescrip mass of $hgtIIIhide on a $hgtIIIsize humanoid form roams, faceless and terrible.~
   If human this once was, it is no longer - sexless, faceless, and almost 
fleshless, it stands $hgtIIIdescrip. In place of skin, $hgtIIIhide. Where the 
face once was has now been stripped of flesh, leaving only a grinning and 
bleached white skull. Dried blood clots form in the cavities that once held 
eyes, a nose, an inner ear - and all of it runs, sticky and warm, down the 
sides of this thing's head. Out of the maw twists, curls, and seeks an 
obscenely long red tongue covered in pustules and seeping liquid. A great 
goiter runs from under the remainder of the jaw, and stretches to mid-chest, 
bulging and constantly moving as if something is beneath. A few remnants of 
humanity remain in $hgtIIIsize.

#6A slender, ebony-haired asian woman lingers here, spectrally.#0~
   Pale, tawny flesh covers this woman's face and her somewhat 
compressed facial features. A flattened nose hangs just above 
her thin, pinkish lips and separates her two eyes with black 
irises. The epicanthic folds on her eyelids and her thin, black 
eyebrows suggest asian descent. Her straight black hair is tied 
meticulously into a tight ponytail at the back of her head. Her 
unremarkable, but quite skinny body is interrupted by a small 
bulge of deflated fat near the lower half of her abdomen, 
suggesting significant weight loss in a short period of time. 
The delicate fingers on her tiny hands are marred with massive 
calluses that give the skin a nearly see-through off-white 
colour.

#6A buxom lady with an hourglass figure flickers in and out of view here.#0~
   There is very little about this lady that cannot be described 
as voluptuously curvaceous. Her round face bears a prominent 
roman nose that is shadowed on either side by high, defined 
cheekbones. Soft hazel-coloured eyes peek out from behind a mass 
of baggy skin and light brown eyebrows. Her hair is 
painstakingly styled into clumps of spiky hair that reflect a 
brilliant, nearly-blinding sheen. Despite the evident femininity 
of her curves, strong shoulders, muscled forearms and 
barrel-shaped thighs suggest significant physical strength. 
However, the most prominent feature of her body are her 
pendulously large breasts that seem out of place, even on a woman 
of her bulk.

a waspish man of curiously mixed-race~
A waspish man of indefinable racial background stands here.~
   The light mahogany colour of this man's skin is peppered 
around his pocketed cheeks, distributed in an uneven smattering 
pattern. Shaped into a compact, bucket-fro, this man's deeply 
brown hair maintains its consistency, but is not sufficiently 
wiry to prevent his hair from bouncing about loftily on his scalp 
as he moves. Small, beady eyes with irises that are so black 
they are nearly indistinguishable from the pupils are hidden 
under thinly folded eyelids and sparse black brows. His waspish 
figure is bent slightly near where his spine meets his neck, 
forcing him to bend his neck sharply in order to look upward. 
The liver-spotted flesh that dangles loosely from his angular 
bits is wrinkled and purples faintly near his fingertips.

#6A fibrous man stands here, covered in scars and tattoos.#0~
   Of average height and light build, this man's body is riddled 
with scars. Pockmarks and slashes cover the majority of his 
frame, and his back and left shoulder are covered in one large 
burn scar; a scar that obvious signs of skin-grafting and other 
surgeries have ultimately failed to hide. His right forearm is 
covered by a tattoo sleeve - it starts at the inside of his wrist 
with a grinning skull, a dagger stuck in its eye. The skull is 
on fire, and the flames weave up and around his arm, forming 
various patterns and pictures. The tattoo ends at his neck, the 
flames licking at his jugular. Upon his head is sat a mess of 
thick black hair, reaching just to his hazel eyes. His nose is 
crooked, as if broken long ago, and sits above thin lips and a 
squared jaw. Overall, this man hasn't an ounce of fat on him, 
his weathered and beaten body is muscular, though wasted slightly 
from unuse.

   This human has hardened, grizzled features that suggest that 
they have survivored through desperate circumstances; they bear 
scars, or missing eyes and fingers, or have a hardened and wary 
glint in their watchful eyes. They are physically rugged and fit 
as well, despite whatever their genetic demeanor and disposition 
may be. They stand, act, or move about with a slow routine that

   This robotic arthropod is about four-to-six inches long and 
has two pairs of metallic wheel-legs that seem to retract out of

own purpose. It is no larger than a big rat, moves quickly and

   This young man has smooth skin the colour of burnt caramel. 
He is muscular and fit, smooth-faced, and his hair has been 
shaven to show the entirety of his rounded, shiny bald head. He 
has a tattoo on his left upper arm, well above the elbow, on the 
meat of his bicep; it depicts the Bird, Ball and Chain of the 
United States Marine Corps. He has very little hair on his body: 
an almost hairless chest, and sparsely hairy arms. His eyes are 
so intensely light in hue, that they appear to be a nearly 
translucent blue.

EGT3 insectoid $egtsize $egtIVhide $egtIVtail tail~
a $egtsize, $egtivhide insectoid~
A $egtsize, $egtivhide insectoid trails slime along its crawling path.~
   Of a $egtsize, this creature bears perhaps thousands of multi-jointed legs 
along its segmented body, each bristling with tiny, razor-sharp wires. It is 
shaped like an elongated teardrop and resembles some sort of insect between a 
centipede, millipede, and silverfish. The head is at the rounded end, bearing 
rows of serrated teeth on the underside and jointed mandibles at the front. 
Sticky green goo constantly drips from its maw. A distance above the mouth sit 
two forward-facing, lidless eyes - completely crystal-blue and bearing no 
emotion. Its entire shape is pitch black in color, with a shiny and faintly 
metallic sheen. The hide itself is formed into $egtIVhide. At the back, 
pointed end of the body is $egtIVtail, dripping a thick, translucent green 
liquid.

a $egtvdesc, $egtvfeature insectoid with sets of $egtvwing wings~
A $egtvdesc, $egtvfeature insectoid with sets of $egtvwing wings is here.~
   Even though it is twelve feet long, this insectoid resembles some bastard 
child of a centipede, millipede, and a silverfish. It is long, segemented, and 
many-legged with a size that is $egtvdesc. Like a terran insectoid magnified 
to absolutely horrific levels. A few outstanding features are in $egtvfeature. 
Each body segment is hard, oily black chtiin that as a glossy high shine. In 
between each plate is a tough, but lean, rubbery hide that is marbled pink and 
black. The barbed tip of a vaguely scorpion-like tail oozes slimy green 
liquid, syrupy and thick. Its head is snout-like, one long and grotesque, 
jagged nose with mandibles that secrete that same liquid slime. The jaw itself 
is long and serrated, without any proper teeth. On either side, facing 
forward, are half-sphere eyes in a translucent crystal-blue hue. Along its 
back, on every segment, are three pairs of $egtvwing wings. They run the 
length of the back and are in constant motion: flapping, flexing, folding, or 
unfurling.

#6A golden phoenix hovers here, wings ablaze.#0~
   Enormous in size, the feathers of this bird are golden in 
color, and emit a soft, outward glow. Serene blue eyes are on 
either side of its head, providing a sharp contrast to the 
glorious gold, red, and orange that make up the rest of the 
avian's colors. Its massive wings and elongated tail are wrapped 
in flames, fed from a source unseen, licking at the air. The 
source of all light in this area, this awe-inspiring creature 
floats with ease.

figure distorted blood bathed~
a distorted, blood-bathed figure~
A distorted, vaguely humanoid figure looms here, drenched in blood.~
   Blood drips from this colossal figure's form, pools around its disfigured 
feet, and no light seems to touch it. It takes the shape of a man - but its 
shape is imperfect. Polygons jut at odd angles from its distorted face, their 
sharpened, often second-dimension tips dripping dark crimson. Offset eyes glow 
like coals, unblinking, from the depths of a too-heavy brow. The figure's 
frame, however, is muscular and powerful - its barrel chest and tree-trunk arms 
are clearly distinguishable, even through the occasional torn polygon. Covered 
head-to-toe in blood that has no source, this monstrous figure looms, absorbing 
light, casting shadows.

#6A thin, middle-aged asian male#0 is hunched over here, shaking slightly.~
   Skinny and aging, this light-skinned man's joints are knobby 
and awkwardly-angled. He is balding, but some thin wisps of 
solid white hair still cling to the sides of his head, combed 
neatly down. His features are blunted and wrinkled and a little 
squished, seemingly pulled to the center of his face.

The hulking, mutated form of a plain, bay-haired man roams nearby.~
   Standing a little above normal height, this man has shaggy bay 
colored hair in a straight style, coming to rest wildly at the 
middle of his neckline. A set of slightly curved eyebrows lay 
before chocolate brown eyes, set in an oval shape. Aquiline in 
shape, a nose sits above thin lips. This man's shoulders are 
broad and lopsided, and his frame is twisted with knotted muscle. 
Two lanky arms rest by a well-built chest and torso. Turned 
inwards, the left of them possibly broken, his legs come down 
with multiple scars scattered across his thighs, knees and 
calves. His face and form are covered in blood, and his 
boil-covered tongue vibrates constantly from where it hangs 
outside of his broken mouth.

Jenkins weedy green eyed man~
a weedy, green-eyed man~
A weedy, green-eyed man stands here.~
   Average in height, this man is particularly scrawny, his 
joints knobbly. He has a rather haggard look about him - his 
dark hair reaches to his shoulders and is pulled back, wrapped 
into a loose ponytail with a bit of cloth. A full beard, brown, 
adorns his face, several inches long and unwashed. Bright green 
eyes peer from beneath thin eyebrows, and his nose is crooked, 
broken once a time before. His body does, however, sport a bit 
of muscle, as well as its own share of scars.

a towering bald man of mahogany hue~
A bald, mahogany brute towers here.~
   This man towers over most others, approaching six and a half 
feet tall with the build of a barbarian. He has very little body 
fat apparent, and thick layers of muscle dominate his upper body 
and legs. There is a hard look in his coal eyes that belies an 
ever-wary expression. He is entirely bald, though thick black 
eyelashes and a surprisingly well-kept black beard give stark 
contrast to his otherwise blemishless face. His nose is wide and 
flat and his ears are large and round. The man appears to be 
mature, but not past the last stages of youth. His lips are 
large and brown, and his entire skin tone is a wash of dark brown 
and red.

A spheroid robot with long antenna hovers here.~
   This small, spheroid robot hovers here with a low hum on 
anti-grav engines, a single exhaust port running along it's back 
side. Four long antenna sprout from it's circumference, 
extending three feet behind the robot. At its front, a single 
red lens, several inches in diameter, observes its surroundings. 
On it's right side, a stylized "GC" is visible.

front of the robot, while on its back a small, stylized "GC" is 
visible.

A young teen girl with big, blue eyes stands here watching.~
   Just in the early stages of puberty, this young girl would appear to be 
around twelve or so. She is beginning to gain some height, but is still quite 
a bit shorter than an adult, with a slender body just beginning to fill out. 
Freckles dot her small nose, but are barely visible against the backdrop of her 
browned skin. Blonde hair tumbles in an unruly fashion down to her shoulders, 
framing a round face with a pair of large, crystal blue eyes.

QueenAngelique Angelique colossal metallic sheened insectoid exotic facial features Angie Queen3 EGT5 xHAL_RPTDONOTTOUCH~
a colossal, metallic-sheened insectoid with exotic facial features~
A colossal, metallic-sheened insectoid with exotic facial features rears up, tentacles and tail held poised to strike.~
   Absolutely huge, this arthropod is roughly the length of three men - or 
about thirteen feet long. Numerous segments make up its body, the ones behind 
the head thicker, broader, and more domed while towards the rear they gradually 
get smaller and flatter. Eventually, they turn into an almost scorpion-like 
tail which is held curled over the back, ending in a wicked barb covered in 
viscuous, green liquid. Armored legs sprawl out from each segment starting 
halfway down the body, growing smaller and ending just before the tail's base. 
Along each segment are chitinous flaps - three pair to each - which are capable 
of flipping up to reveal small wings covered in a light coating of green slime. 
The tops of the shell have numerous ridges, and scaly patches, the chitin a 
pitch-black with a faint metallic silver sheen. Past chinks in the body armor 
can be seen rubbery hide underneath, marbled in pink, grey, and black. On the 
upper half of the body, legs become a number of tentacles lined with hooks or 
suckers; except for two, which are long, slender pincers. The head itself is 
somewhat flattened, with two large, globular eyes in a brilliant blue. Small 
mandibles are at the front, but flanked by larger, pincer like ones that drip 
more of the green liquid. Above, a pair of antennae are in constant activity, 
whipping this way and that. The underside is considerably softer than the 
back, the translucent metallic scales almost snakelike. Pushing out against 
the ones right beneath the insectoid head is the distorted, exotic-featured 
face of a woman. There are darker, deeper lines around her crystalline blue 
eyes, and her features are pulled into a sneer. Some might recognize the 
visage as formerly belonging to a dusky-skinned woman with kohl-lined eyes.

a $zombieone $zombietwo Grunger~
A $zombieone, $zombietwo Grunger stumbles about here.~
   Despite the $zombieone and $zombietwo nature of this $zombiename, you can 
still recognize this person as human. Although the vacant gaze of their 
fused-open eyes and slack hanging jaw are clear indications that they are 
likely beyond any help. A persistent, guttural groaning issues forth from 
their ruined gullet, hands twitching off of their own accord. Most movements 
are shuffling and awkward, save for the occasional savage gesture of speed. 
Strange growths and boils have broken out across their skin, and a heavy 
thumping, as if a gargantuan heart beats slowly, echoes from its chest. 
Tattered shreds of what looks like every phase Grunger clothing hangs from 
their body, torn apart from their malformations.

A durable, blocky humanoid robot idles here.~
   This robot is nothing if not solid. Designed for carrying things from place 
to place, this robot is a little smaller than your average human, but noticably 
stronger. There's not a lot of grace to its movements, but there is a lot of 
power. It's clearly seen better days. The metal its made of is corroded, and 
some wires stick out from various joints. The face is vaguely humanoid as 
well, though the dented features and backlit eyes lend an unsettling look to 
it.
