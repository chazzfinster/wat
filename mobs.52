a $ratfeature rat~
A $ratfeature rat scurries here.~
This mangy, emaciated creature scurries around frantically, darting from shadow to shadow to either eat or hide from predators or both. It sports all the features of a rat: beady eyes, a long, hairless tail, and a squat body. $ratfeature.

a $crochealth, $crocdeform, $lizcolor crocodile~
A $crochealth, $crocdeform, $lizcolor crocodile crawls around here.~
   Dark red eyes sit atop its reptilian head, which seems to be 
made out of absolutely nothing but teeth. Notable about this 
particular crocodile is $crochealth. Not to mention $crocdeform. 
$lizcolor Altogether, the beast gives a rather formidable 
appearance.

A $lizcolor, $zoomersized lizard zips about.~
   This smaller lizard darts about at obscene speeds on all 
fours. $lizcolor It stands $zoomersized While it bears a row of

much harm to a larger creature.

Vunderpus tentacled monstrosity black exoskeleton~
a tentacled monstrosity with a black exoskeleton~
A tentacled monstrosity with a black exoskeleton clings to the walls.~
   The center of this beast's body is just one part - something 
of an orb, covered mostly in a hairy black exoskeleton. The 
bottom of this orb is unprotected; however, it splits right down 
the middle and, when opened, reveals a row of razored teeth and a 
black hole of a mouth, from which an oddly human-like tongue 
dangles. Eight legs sprout from the center of this beast's body, 
each of them clad in a segmented, solid black exoskeleton, 
somewhat resembling a suit of armor. Two tentacles are attached 
to opposite sides of its body, about double the length of the 
legs, and unprotected - they could twist this way and that 
completely unhindered. If it stood straight up this monster 
would be about ten feet tall, with its tentacles reaching a total 
of twenty feet.
