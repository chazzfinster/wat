a blue-painted, $gladiator man~
A blue-painted, $gladiator man is here.~
   Blue paint is splattered over this $gladiator man's body. He 
looks a rough and ready sort of individual, covered in scars and 
blemishes, his face a ravaged network of old injuries, scars, and 
stubble. A set of steely eyes calmly appriases all before him, 
and he looks ready to lash out with violence in response to any 
situation. His hair is cut short to prevent it being grabbed or 
yanked, and his nails are similarly shortened.

Ricky diminuitive slick haired man xBettaker xArena~
a diminuitive, slick-haired man~
A diminutive, slick-haired man is here, signing up new gladiators.~
   Small and scrawny, this weedy little man has black hair, 
slicked back over his scalp to reveal his receding widow's peak. 
His features are sharp and animalistic, nearly predatory - 
narrowed eyes sit close above a jutting nose and chin, an angular 
jaw, and high cheekbones; all of it is clean-shaven.

A plain-looking, goateed man stands here, signing people up.~
   Unremarkable pretty much sums up the whole of this man's 
appearance. He has brown hair and brown eyes, a slightly pudgy 
face, and an average build. His body hold a few scars, but none 
that are incredibly noticeable - most are just light scratches on 
his arms or legs, and his face is entirely untouched.

Jeremy tall man mechanical robotic eye xSawbones~
a tall, mechanical-eyed man~
A tall man with robotic eyes stands here, tending the wounded.~
   Probably the most noticeable thing about this man (besides his 
height) are his eyes - both are mechanical, the steel glinting 
dully in any light, whirring as he looks this way and that. 
Otherwise, he holds a pretty boring face; the man's hair is 
blonde and parted down the middle, his nose is long and crooked, 
and he has the faintest hint of underbite, his jutting chin 
attesting to that. His skinny arms end in almost delicate hands, 
his long fingers soft and uncalloused.

A wiry, thin-limbed older man stands here.~
   This old man is characterized by knobby joints and wrinkles - 
what was once a muscular body has deteriorated with age, a mere 
ghost of what it must have been before. The near-emaciated state 
of his body makes his head look overly-large on his skinny neck. 
While he sports a full head of hair, it is all a dull gray, from 
his head to his eyebrows to the few whiskers that adorn his face. 
His eyes are a dazzling shade of green, and his nose is long and 
crooked.

A gangly, dark-haired man stands here.~
   This tall, skinny man carries himself confidently. Dark brown 
hair covers his head, cut just above his bright green eyes. His 
body is built somewhat like a twig; if he has any muscle or fat 
it is cleverly hidden. Otherwise, there is nothing outstanding 
or particular about him - he has no out-of-place scars or 
blemishes, just what would be found common among men his age, and 
he just appears rather unremarkable.

   This guy is pretty short, but he makes up for that in width. 
He has a barrel chest and small, thick arms that end in stubby

the edges. He is, pretty inarguably, ugly.

A blocky, pear-headed man loiters here.~
   This man's face looks like a bad brick-laying job - his facial 
bones juts out at odd, blocky angles, and the skin that stretches 
tightly across these bones is covered in all manner of surgical 
scars. The rest of his body is no different; his limbs lock in 
positions that seem nearly ready to bend in the opposite 
direction, and his muscles seem to cling poorly to these. He 
does not particularly look like he could be a mutant - he's just 
really, really ugly.

A stout, sun-ravaged man stands here.~
   This man's black hair is cropped short and sits in a tangled 
mess atop his head. His features are wrinkled and tanned from 
exposure to the elements. Two light eyebrows sit over piercing 
green yes, which is then followed by a lightly bent nose, thin 
lips, and a strong chin. His neck leads down to a brawny body, 
over which lies darkly-tanned, weatherbeaten skin. He sports 
broad shoulders and muscled arms, which come to an end at the 
fingertips of calloused hands.

Rego Cortez muscular young man xWilmington~
a muscular young man~
A muscular young man with mismatched eyes stands here.~
   This man's thick, tangled mass of black hair falls several 
inches shy of his shoulders. Mismatched eyes peer out from under 
heavy brows, one an electric blue and the other a bright green. 
A long, red scar runs horizontally under his eyes, notching the 
bridge of his already crooked nose. His body is lean and 
muscular, and there can be found an occasional scar marring his 
body. Two gnarled and bumped hands are attached to his muscular 
arms while thick legs support his light body.

Prowler agile claw-handed woman xShadows~
an agile, claw-handed woman~
An agile, claw-handed woman stands here.~
   This woman is of average height and fairly muscular - but she 
is in no way bulky. Her skin is smooth and her features are 
fine. Her face is unblemished, with high cheek bones, a button 
nose, a pointed chin, and full lips. Her brown eyes peer out 
from beneath thin eyebrows, and she is rather well-groomed. Her 
hair is combed neatly, roughly shoulder-length. Her body holds 
its share of curves as well. Despite all this, however, the most 
noticeable thing about this woman are her hands. Thick green, 
bristly scales start at the wrist and cover them, and each finger 
ends with a two-inch long, solid-black claw.

Ramon Duoms hardened leathery skinned man xAnarchists~
a hardened, leathery-skinned man~
A hardened, leathery-skinned man stands here.~
   This man's hair is black as jet and mangily groomed. While 
not long, with his bangs halting just under his eyebrows and the 
rest just barely covering his ears, it still manages to appear 
ragged and unwashed. His eyebrows are thick caterpillars, 
sitting above dark hazel eyes, a slightly hooked nose, and a 
squared jaw. A ragged scar tears its way around the right side 
of his face, starting at his temple and zigzagging down to the 
point of his chin. His body is lank, carrying its share of scars 
without managing to appear mangled. His skin is, however, fairly 
leathery, attesting to years of extreme weather exposure. His 
knuckles are ragged and bumped, and his forearms are marked by 
claw marks. The rest of his body is a proportionate mix of 
height and muscles, with the ratio tilting more to the former; he 
is noticeably tall and fit, not bulky.

A thick-necked, barrel-chested man stands here.~
   'Big' is an accurate description of this man. He has all the 
typical cliches of a big guy, with his broad shoulders and barrel 
chest, thick neck that is nearly nonexistant and lantern jaw. 
His body is build like a rock, all hardened muscles and gray skin 
that wraps around it in a craggy, wrinkly fashion.

A lank, green-eyed man stands here.~
   This man's hair is dark brown and wild, its wavy locks falling 
to his shoulders. Dull green eyes and a long, crooked nose peer 
from beneath it-- whenever it's parted, or pushed to the side. 
His eyebrows are slightly thick, and the left one is separated 
through the middle by a thin, pale scar. His cheeks are 
gaunt--accentuating his high cheekbones and firm jaw, which is, 
in turn, covered by a shaggy growth of stubble. His face bears a 
few scars of hardship, but no wrinkles of age. His body is lean, 
thin, taut, and covered in scars of all shapes and sizes.

Roy Trayer scruffy young man xAnarchists~
a scruffy young man~
A scruffy young man stands here.~
   Dark brown hair hangs limply just past the tips of this young 
man's ears in scraggly disarray - fraying and tangled against the 
inner curve of them. His skin, while by no means dark by birth, 
is unevenly tanned by nature- sunburn scalding the bridge of his 
nose and cheeks, the tops of his shoulders, and a darker flush 
bronzing his chest, back and forearms. His legs are curiously 
pale, and the tops of his feet. His fingernails have been all 
chewed to the quick and are grimed beneath by dirt; his hands are 
rough but relatively hairless - the same as his chest, the hairs 
on which are scraggly and few and far between. He is lanky to 
the point of being gaunt, but nevertheless has a muscular set to 
him: his arms and chest defined, if not toned, and legs hard for 
all their lack of bulk. His eyes are a dark, matte green; he 
seems to bear few scars.

Tameo barbate hazel eyed man xVultures~
a barbate, hazel-eyed man~
A barbate, hazel-eyed man stands here.~
   Black, shaggy hair flecked with grey specks covers this man's 
head, parted in the middle to keep it out of his face as much as 
possible. His dark brows are thick and arch over hard, hazel 
eyes, set deep into the man's skull. He has perpetual bags under 
them, giving them the appearance of being constantly blackened. 
His large nose juts from the front of his head and is dented 
considerably in the center. His lips are thin and nearly without 
color; only the vaguest pink touches them. His angular jawline 
is shrouded in dark stubble. His neck is thin and leads down to 
a narrow chest, thin shoulders, and long, gangly limbs. While 
not emaciated, the man is obviously undernourished; his joints 
are knobbly and poke out through his dark skin. The man shares 
his hair of battlescars, ranging from pockmarks to long, ragged 
tears, ripping across his flesh in a garish pink.

A white-maned, dark-skinned man stands here.~
   This man's hair is pulled back away from his face, dropping 
down to his mid-back and colored white, though accumulated dust 
makes it more of a gray color. His white hair contrasts the 
darkness of his skin, nearly dark enough to cause his features to 
blend in together, if they weren't matted with scars. Colored a 
pale pink, they stretch and curve and zig-zag across thick lips 
and a blunted nose; they cross dangerously close to his pale 
green eyes, but the both of them are intact. The rest of his 
body is similarly coated in all manner of the pale scars, warping 
his skin, though none of them seem bad enough to have caused any 
structural damage.

   Wild, reddish-colored hair sprouts in every direction from 
this man's head. Long, shoulder length strands fall freely, 
falling into his face if left unchecked. His flat green eyes 
peer out of a narrow face, and a pair of thin lips sit under his 
pointy nose. Dark, weathered skin is littered with lightened 
scars, each one a shade of pink that mars his darker flesh. A 
set of long sinewy arms are connected to this man's bulky chest 
which is supported by a pair of massive, sturdy looking legs, 
making this man's huge frame truly something.

   Bull-necked, broad-shouldered, trunk-limbed, and 
barrel-chested - these cliches and more can be used to describe 
this man's appearance. Built like a brick and a cinderblock had 
a hairy child, his features are as blocky as either, with a 
heavy, sloped brow, a blunted nose, and a lantern jaw. His head 
is covered by a thick, tangled mass of black hair that seems to 
have no end; a thick beard covers the majority of his face, and 
no small amount of the thick stuff also covers his chest, back, 
arms and legs, whenever exposed. Hidden beneath this carpet are 
multiple scars of different types, a few big, a few small.

A big-handed, broad-shouldered man stands here.~
   Black, unkempt hair shoots out in every direction from this 
man's head. Deep blue eyes peer out of sunken eye sockets, and a 
long scar crosses the left side of his face. His large nose is 
awkwardly bent, as if once broken and set improperly, and his 
large cracked lips hide a set of dark yellow teeth. Though his 
attributes might suggest this man of poor health, one look at his 
form says otherwise. His long arms are knotted with hardened 
muscle and end in massive, calloused hands. His huge torso is 
supported by a set of sturdy looking legs and his shoulders are 
framed in such a way to draw himself to his full height with 
little effort.

A robo-armed, sanguine-mohawked woman stands here.~
   Slightly grayed with dust, this human female's hair sticks up 
from the center line of her scalp in long, blood-red strands. 
Shaved on either side, her hair is done in even spikes, each one 
about half a foot long, jutting upwards. The crimson spikes 
match a pair of razor-thin brows that streak over a pair of 
slanted, inky-green eyes. Between her dark eyes, a high-bridged 
nose that tends toward beakiness sits dominant over a dour mouth 
adorned with parched and cracked lips. Exposure to dry, lifeless 
air has given her feral face and sinew-brushed limbs the 
appearance of being cast from weathered granite, with skin 
further dulled and marred heavily with an assortment of scars and 
branding-like burns spaced in random intervals around her face 
and body. Taut and lean, with little spare fat to shape any 
curves, her tall frame is touched with the pinched and narrow 
appearance of malnutrition. Her left arm is a series of 
uncovered wires and hydraulics, sprouting out of her shoulder, 
jointed at the elbow, and ending in four metal claws.

Bjork greasy nearly toothless man xDoghouse xShopkeep~
a greasy, nearly-toothless man~
A greasy, nearly-toothless man is here, polishing a dirty glass with a dirty rag.~
   This filthy man is slightly hunched, often wearing a 
snaggle-toothed grin. Altogether, his mouth probably holds a 
total of seven teeth, and each of those is cracked and yellowed. 
His hair is slick with grease, the black strands clinging 
desperately to his scalp. He has a crooked nose, a gaunt face, 
sunken eyes, grayish skin, and a general air of malnutrition - 
with no fat on his body, the bit of muscle that he has is 
stretched taut over his knobbly skeleton. 

You can #2SELL BOOZE#0 or #2SELL SPIRITS#0 to this man.

Maxine svelte raven bobbed woman xShopkeep xHeady~
a svelte, raven-bobbed woman~
A svelte, raven-bobbed woman stands here, surrounded by smoke.~
   Lean lines, taut with muscle, make up the slender contour of 
this raven-haired woman's physique. Sloe eyes, long lashed and 
heavy-lidded, make a dark match to smooth, almost glassy-black 
hair which is cut in a neat bob at her chin. Pencil-thin 
eyebrows, sharply-defined features and a svelte form with only a 
hint of curve to guide the eye, nonetheless allows her to cut a 
striking figure. As if an appeasement to classical feminine 
beauty, her mouth is lusciously shaped and full, and bears a 
glossy, red hue which contrasts against the paleness of her skin 
and breaks the monochrome of her coloring.

a debonair, slick-haired man~
A debonair, slick-haired man stands here, tending the patronage.~
   This guy is pretty swanky, with dark, slick-backed hair and a 
neatly-trimmed goatee. Dark eyes peer from beneath trimmed 
eyebrows, and his nose holds a slightly downwards hook. He 
apparently goes through no small effort to keep himself clean - 
his features and body are spotless, and his tanned skin kept 
oiled. His body, similarly, is taken care of; he is fit without 
being overly bulky, and toned.

Jack gruff hunched man xJack xShopkeep~
a gruff, hunched man~
A gruff, hunched man tends the counter here.~
   This man's hair is colored - perhaps died - a dark red. The 
locks are long and greasy and parted down the middle, exposing 
his forehead. His ears are blunt, and his hair is tucked back 
behind them. Cool blue eyes are situated beneath thin brows, and 
his cheeks are gaunt, making his cheekbones seem to jut outwards. 
His lips are thin and cracked, and his mouth is lined with 
stained yellow teeth. The rest of his body bears little 
distinction - a not-quite-emaciated frame, scarred pale skin, 
wiry arms and legs. He stands at a slight hunch, perhaps owing 
to years of manual labor.

a thickly-built, blockish man~
A thickly-built, blockish man sells junk.~
   A thick mane of blonde hair falls from this man's head, with 
the bangs and sides cut into a crude mullet. His brows are heavy 
and sit above an ugly face-- square and blockish, a crooked nose 
and brown eyes. A whipvine scar adorns the right side of his jaw 
and moves with his expression, or when he talks. He is slightly 
taller than average, and his limbs sport thick, corded muscles. 
His knuckles are gnarled and bumped, but his fingers are in 
particularly good shape, long and only calloused on the tips of 
the fingers.

Isabella swarthy night eyed young woman xSassy xShopkeep~
a swarthy, night-eyed young woman~
A swarthy, night-eyed young woman sells clothes, here.~
   Thick inky hair, crowns this woman's head in a shorn style, 
chopped roughly off at chin length, and even shorter over her 
almond-shaped eyes. Their hue is as deep as night, a black which 
renders her pupils indistinct from the iris. Swarthy and dark, 
her lips curve in full lines beneath the aquiline shape of her 
nose. Thinly tattooed lines trace shadows over the exposed 
majority of her richly-hued skin, tinted to the shade of 
deeply-caramalized sugar. Her limbs, wiry with muscle, reflect 
the lines of her torso, but even the sinew lining her frame does 
a poor job hiding the feminine curves which mark her sex.

A pencil-necked, spidery-fingered man watches the store, here.~
   This man is particularly skinny and particularly covered in 
wrinkles - his head, made to seem all the larger because of the 
pitiful state of his neck - is wrapped in what could be layers of 
leathery, wrinkly, brown skin. It nearly hides his features 
completely, though his pale blue eyes can be seen peeking through 
the folds. His body is frail and done up tightly in that brown 
skin of his. His limbs are long, and his arms end in long, 
dextrous fingers.

a big, nine-fingered man~
A big, nine-fingered man watches over the store.~
   This man is pretty big, and he is made entirely out of muscle. 
Attributing to a long life of hard labor, his form is rock-solid, 
and he stands ramrod straight. While big, he is by no means a 
pretty man - his face looks to have been rearranged with a 
particularly disagreeing brick, and he has a hair-lip. His hair 
is light brown and is cropped in no particular order. The pinky 
finger of his left hand is missing.

A seedy, blue-eyed man watched the store, or over his shoulder.~
   This man's blue eyes are constantly shifting this way and 
that, the movements holding a nervous quality. His brows are 
heavy, those eyes sunken, and his pointed nose is crooked. He 
has a receding hair line. The man is pretty scrawny, too - his 
arms are lanky and long, as well as his legs.

Ismael really big man scars xIsmael xShopkeep~
a really big man with scars~
A really big man with scars is here, selling goods.~
   This guy is built like the Perimeter - taller than anyone and 
nearly as wide. His body ripples with muscles; in fact, the man 
might as well be a sea of muscle. All of this is barely 
contained by darkly-tanned skin. His black hair is buzzed short 
atop his large head, though he does sport a pair of fairly long 
sideburns.

Troy dapper dark haired gentleman man xSex xShopkeep~
a dapper, dark-haired gentleman~
A dapper, dark-haired gentleman mans the storefront.~
   Perhaps the most noticeable thing about this suave man is his 
mustache - a solid black handlebar mustache, it is neatly combed 
to either side of his face, about eight inches in total length. 
Thick as it is, it makes his mouth nearly indiscernable. Short, 
dark brown hair adorns the top of his head, combed very neatly to 
the right. His nose is rather small, and above it sits hazel eyes 
under groomed eyebrows.

Sabrina sinewy frosty haired woman xBuzzard xShopkeep~
a sinewy, frosty-haired woman~
A sinewy, frosty-haired woman stands here.~
   The pale, moon-white skin that covers this small woman's form 
matches uncannily with her frosty-white, silver-touched hair. 
These features, when combined with the glacial silver-blue of her 
large eyes, give her a look of iciness only offset by the natural 
upward bow of her full lips. Her hair has been bluntly chopped 
at shoulder length, leaving unruly locks of the thick tresses to 
fall against the deceptively delicate features of her face to 
veil them. Her body is sinewy with muscle, the small frame toned 
and packed with a wiry strength and energy that is suffused 
through her lithe limbs with each movement.

Sam dirty gnarly man xSam xShopkeep~
a dirty, gnarly man~
A dirty, gnarly man attends the storefront.~
   White hair, swept haphazardly back, covers this man's head in 
thick tangles. His eyes are dark green and are evenly spaced 
over a slighty-upturned nose. Light scars run dark crisscrosses 
over his face, though none are particularly large or notable. He 
is slightly tall, for a guy, and his body is muscular, though not 
heavily built. Weathered skin is stretched tightly over long 
arms and legs, interrupted occasionally by scars. Arms and legs 
end in calloused hands and feet, described respectively with 
long, gnarled fingers and stubby toes.

a clean, short man~
A clean, short man attends to patients and medical supplies.~
   This tiny man is rather clean, and rather short. He's about 
two heads shorter than most, and skinny, to boot. His slender 
frame is borderline emaciated, with the occasional rib and other 
bone poking out. His head is shaved, and he overall appears 
pretty hairless.

a bald-headed man with a goatee~
A bald-headed man with a goatee watches the counter.~
   Light blue eyes have been set shallow in this man's narrow, 
fair-skinned face. Above a pair of thin lips sits a slightly 
crooked nose, a distinct bump in the center suggesting an 
improperly set fracture. Faded scars mark his pale skin, a long, 
pink slash under his left eye being the most notable. His head 
has been shaven bald, a black goatee serving as his only facial 
hair. Hardened muscle supports his frame, forcing his shoulders 
back to further compliment his height.

woman inky-skinned behemoth~
an inky-skinned behemoth of a woman~
An inky-skinned behemoth of a woman manages a low-brow sect of auction stalls in this section of the market.~
   Encased in a preponderous amount of blubber and muscle, this 
behemoth of a human appears to be female, or at least somewhat 
curvier than would be typically considered masculine. Though her 
head has been shaved, the fuzz that remains is far lighter than 
her skin tone, with a reddish cast. It is her skin, however, 
that offers her the majority of her coloration: it is a rich, 
almost purplish black which sets off the whites of her brown eyes 
and the numerous wire and stud piercings spiking her large ears, 
lips and broad nose. Small scars bite into her skin, salting the 
black with silvery specks and her enormous hands are 
spade-fingered and heavily calloused.

a squat, fork-bearded man~
A squat, fork-bearded man organizes the auction, yelling and gesturing vividly.~
   This little man's bearing belies his stature. Confident and brusque, he 
manages a commanding presence despite being a full head shorter than most. His 
arms are thick with the musculature of hard work which, combined with his 
bow-legged posture, lends him a slightly comical appearance. His broad, 
subdued facial features are partially obscured by a neat beard, protruding from 
his chin where it forks into three spikes.

a gigantic, dark-eyed man~
A gigantic, dark-eyed man offers various goods for sale.~
   The man is a near giant among men, standing a full head taller 
than most. A thick, tangled mass of hair that reaches his 
shoulders sits atop his head. His eyes are dark brown - nearly 
black. Three parallel red scars are barely visible on the right 
side of his face, the extent of these being covered by other, 
smaller scars. His neck is a maze of interlocking scars, the 
largest of which slices straight across his throat. His massive 
frame sports a webwork of pockmarks, lines, and healed puncture 
wounds. His arms and legs are covered with thick muscles, while 
his knuckles are gnarled and bumped from their being broken and 
then healing over several times in the past. His skin is tanned 
brown in color and he has a tattoo of a bright green snake 
coiling up his back.

An emaciated, one-eared man sells various goods.~
   This man has a perpetually hungry look about him. His hair is 
dyed a blood red and sticks up in short, greasy tufts. His eyes 
are a jaundiced-yellow and his skin is colored a dark brown, 
though mottled white here and there. He is scrawny and his hands 
are callused and scarred-- though his fingers seem unnaturally 
long and nimble. A tattoo depicting a coiled snake, done in 
bright red ink, lies just below his right eye and three short, 
straight scars run across both his wrists. One of his large 
ears, his left, has had the tip torn from it, while his right has 
been altogether removed

Pierre bull necked ham handed man xRevolucion xShopkeep~
a bull-necked, ham-handed man~
A bull-necked, ham-handed man watches the bar.~
   This man's hair is black, dirty, grown long, and swept back 
over his scalp; it is generally kept behind his ears, has the 
upper half of it wasn't torn off. His thick brow slopes 
downwards, nearly hooding his eyes, a muddy brown in color. He 
has a blunted nose what sits over a large, frog-like mouth. He 
has a thick, bullish neck that connects to a barrel chest, from 
which sprout two thickly-muscled and long arms, which furthermore 
end in giant hands. He stands in a hunch. Overall, this man's 
scarred body is thick, muscled, and massive, proving a lifetime 
of exposure and hardships.

a rawboned, weathered man~
A rawboned, weathered man stands here.~
   His dark green eyes peering out of a broad face - they have a 
slight earthen tint to them. Long dark brown hair is tied back 
into a pontail reaching to his shoulders. Hardened muscle can be 
seen beneath his scarred, darkly tanned skin. His somewhat large 
frame is well supported by long legs and his longs arm lead to 
thickly calloused hands.

Jimmy burly hairy man xGuns xShopkeep~
a burly, hairy man~
A burly, hairy man stands at the counter.~
   This man's massive head holds a pair of dark green eyes, which 
sit above a pig-like nose. His mouth is filled with crooked and 
broken teeth, each of which is a varying tint of yellow. A pair 
of long, beefy arms hang from his large and solid looking chest, 
all of this being held up by a set of short, sturdy legs. Any of 
his tanned skin that is exposed is most likely covered in scars. 
The most noticeable one is a large scar that starts from his left 
ear and moves along down his neck, disappearing under his 
coverings.

Tracy lissome chestnut tressed woman xAnarchist xShopkeep~
a lissome, chestnut-tressed woman~
A lissome, chestnut-tressed woman keeps registry, here.~
   Touched with auburn-red highlights, a thick mane of glossy 
tresses, hued a rich, deep brown, spills down the head and over 
the shoulders of this young woman. A few of the tresses fall to 
frame her features, and the deep tint of the locks, which match 
her arching brows, sets off the velvety blue of her cerulean 
eyes. A thin nose and high cheekbones, combined with her small 
chin, serves to give her face a feline cast. Save for a small 
mole which draws attention to her sensitive-looking lips, her 
fair skin is otherwise unmarred by any scar or blemish as it 
stretches over her finely-boned features and slender frame. The 
tone and curvatures of her lissome body suggests a lacking 
familiarity with strenuous physical labor.

A drab, wrinkled woman tends this shop.~
   This woman is rather dull - she has a hard, worn look about 
her, and little else of much mention. Crows feet mark the 
corners of her eyes in hard lines, and the rest of her face is a 
mess of other harsh wrinkles. While her body is bent with age, 
it is not yet broken, with hard muscles lying beneath layers of 
wrinkled skin.

a skinny, brown-eyed woman~
A skinny, brown-eyed woman watches the store.~
   Standing tall and stick thin, this woman has a somewhat 
haunted look with her brown, deep-set eyes and yellow-hued skin 
tone. A lack of color has left her olive skin tone washed out, 
but despite her jaundiced appearance, she actually seems quite 
sturdy. Her long and tenuous limbs are steady, and her posture 
is upright. The hair crowning her head is a rather mousy shade 
of brown, and it falls quite straight and limp down to her 
shoulders.

an Anarchist mob~
An Anarchist mob stands here.~
   This person can only be a member of the Revolutionary Army, 
colloquially known as the Anarchists. From the fiery ardent 
glint in their eyes, to the erect and straight-backed 
military-like posture, $e is an Anarchist through and through.

Lucy Lucretia monstrosity lizard like black wings~
an enormous black lizard-like monstrosity with wings~
An enormous black lizard-like monstrosity with wings soars here.~
   This is a fearsome sight to behold. Towering over thirty-feet 
high, with a twenty-feet wingspan, this monstrosity is larger 
than any lizard has the right to be. Completely covered in 
gleaming, thick black scales, the monster might be considered 
beautiful, if not that it looked completely and utterly 
dangerous. Not to mention the razor-sharp teeth in a gigantic 
maw, the beast has four talons per claw that are as long as a 
man, wicked scimitars that can easily rend flesh and armor as if 
it was paper. Even more fearsome, its head is ridged with dozens 
of white spiny protrusions, like horns, and all along its 
serpentine back. The wings that stretch out, able to encompass 
an entire building, are as black as night, and equally ridged 
with spines.

A typically-built, fiery-haired woman stands here.~
   This woman is neither short nor stocky, or particularly 
remarkable in any way; other than her fiery long hair, 
artificially dyed to be a myriad of orange, yellow, white, and 
black, nothing about her stands out. Her eyes are a dull brown, 
with a long, stern face, and a square jaw. Her skin is tanned 
and leathery, as though she spent most of her days out in the 
harsh sun.

A sharp-featured, wavy-haired older man is here.~
   A dark, weathered skin covers the somewhat spindly frame of 
this older man, it considerably lacking in any muscle. His 
features are angular and sharp in appearance - his nose is 
aquiline and pointed and his cheekbones are high and pointed. 
His face is framed by greasy locks of black hair which often 
dangle haphazardly in front of his dark chestnut eyes.

A dreadlocked, sky-blue-eyed woman is here.~
   This woman's darkened face is framed by thick black dreadlocks 
which hang nearly to her waist at the back. Her features are 
delicate and lend her a habitually kind look: soft lips near 
always drawn in a smile and her thin, neat eyebrows always 
lifted. Her body is curvaceous and shapely, wrought with light 
but noticeable muscle - clearly a sign it is being kept in good 
form.

A gruff-featured, cleanly-trimmed young man is here, tending to the shop-counter.~
   An older adolescent, this young man's head is shaven 
completely bald. His nose is thick and flat, his jaw heavy and 
his arms thick with poorly-defined muscles. He has strikingly 
blue eyes, which peer out from a face marred by slashes and what 
appear to be chemical burns. He's a bit on the shorter side and 
husky, with dark tattoos up and down his arms. His skin is 
tanned an uneven reddish-brown, and freckles dot his form all 
over.
