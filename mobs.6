Ungoliant arachnoid spider sleek surveillance robot~
a sleek, arachnoid surveillance robot~
A sleek, arachnoid surveillance robot lingers, unmoving.~
   This robotic arachnid is roughly two and a half feet long and 
seperated into two sections. From the sleek abdomen sprout eight 
legs, each one segmented with a ball joint in three seperate 
places. Sprouting from the right side of the bulbous abdomen is 
a slotted mount, poking roughly half a foot from the metal 
exoskelton, out of the way of the machine's legs. The head bears 
a singular lensed eye, just below which are a pair of needle-like 
fangs - apparently added just for show more than functionality. 
The entire length of the robot has been painted matte black, sans 
its underbelly, upon which has been emblazoned the word 
"Ungoliant," in blocky red letters.

a rough, blocky, four-wheeled robot~
A rough, blocky, four-wheeled robot scoots around the room.~
   This rough robot is composed of welded and soldered pieces of 
scrap metal and unidentifiable remelted plastics. The clicking 
of gears can be heard inside, while the occasional blue spark 
shows through the cracks in the exterior as the recobbled wiring 
and chipsets arc. This robot has a blocky and utilitarian shape, 
placing function over form. It rests upon four wide wheels 
distributed over two drive axles, providing a sturdy platform and 
powerful movement.
