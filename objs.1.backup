a bent metal pipe~
A bent metal pipe has been discarded here.~
   Roughly five feet in length, this metal pipe has a slight bend 
near the center of it. The entire object is manufactured of 
stainless steel, and would prove as an incredibly suitable weapon 
for bludgeoning.

knife sharp single edged combat METAL~
a sharp, single-edged combat knife~
A sharp combat knife with a single edge lies haphazardly here.~
   This knife is brutal in its simplicity and efficiency. The 
handle is synthesized, non-slip rubber just long enough for a 
hand to fit around with easy comfort. From the hilt upwards is a 
seven-inch, carbon-steel blade terminating in a clip point. The 
handguard is manufactored from the same piece of steel as the 
blade-- a half inch off each side, just above the rubber hilt to 
further prevent any slippage and provide an even better grip. 
The reverse end of the blade has saw teeth machined into the 
steel-- not situated to be used as part of the weapon, but sharp 
enough to cut through most soft material.

A solid steel wrench lies here, glinting in the light.~
   This wrench is solidly constructed of steel and painted glossy 
red. A serial number is stamped into the metal on the handle, 
mid-way up. Altogether, the item is about a foot long and is 
best used as a tool, though could also be used as an improvised 
bludgeoning tool.

   This lightweight crowbar consists of a single titanium bar 
with a curved end and flattened points. At each end of the 
crowbar, there are small fissures for removing nails. While 
clearly designed to serve as a lever, it would also do in a pinch 
as an improvised weapon.

A broken, metal chair leg lies here, its edges crudely sharpened.~
   This chair leg was once one of four, securely attached to a 
table, and probably bolted to the floor. Now, however, it is 
not. One end of this crude weapon is still jagged and sharp and 
twisted from where it was ripped from the rest of the chair, and 
its bottom still has a bolt soldered to it, making it unwieldy in 
combat. It has been hammered partially-flat, and its sides have 
been crudely sharpened.

it will cut prepared food and cooked meats with ease, but will 
likely shatter or snap against anything more resilient. It has a 
rounded tip and a single, dulled edge with mild serration. The 
plastic is white. It is extremely lightweight.

fibreglass mop handle, the actual mophead removed. The chef 
knife has been tied to the fibreglass handle using some kind of

fluted slightly outwards. At one point in time, it attached to a

   This utility knife has a retractable razor blade and a long, 
smooth metal handle. While the blade itself is absolutely 
lethal, sharp, and has a wicked point to complement the razor's 
edge, it does not extend more than an inch or two at most from 
the handle, and it would be useless in any situation but 
extremely close combat.

An axe with a textured, fibreglass handle lies here.~
   This axe is something a fireman would typically carry, and has 
a relatively short fibreglass handle, textured to improve grip. 
A fawn's-foot knob at the end of the handle, slightly hooked 
inwards, ensures that there is minimal slippage. The axe head 
itself is a wedge of titanium that comes to a sharp edge at one 
end, and a metal spike on the other. It is heavy, all the weight 
in the axe head, and very little in the handle.

might prove useful if thrown, though is not perfectly weighted 
for such. Its bottom half has been wrapped several times by 
electrical tape, providing some grip.

It stands roughly four feet high and its surface is covered in 
deep black felt. The felt is specked here and there by white 
spots - presumably stars - and in the exact center is a blue and 
green planet wrapped in the wings of a flaming bird. The legs 
are made of a dark composite materal, disguised to look like 
wood. Altogether it is a fairly regale piece.

sword luminescent fighting blade reddish-orange OTHER xVR-weapon xHulk~
a luminescent fighting blade~
A luminescent sword floats in the air.~
   The smooth, flawless black handle of this fighting blade is 
without decoration save for a small red button located beneath 
the handguard, ringed by a glimmering band of steel. When 
pressed the top of the hilt begins to bud with yellowish colour 
that builds into a darker tone of orange within a matter of 
seconds before a whirl of energy smoothly slips into existance, 
shaped from it. The energy forms a long, sleek blade that is 
completely transparent, though radiates a reddish-orange light 
that often emits small veins of energy that run like along the 
base of the weapon, releasing harmless static on the odd 
interval.

A luminescent combat knife floats in the air.~
   This combat knife sports a smooth black handle that is 
completely without decoration save for a small red button located 
beneath the handguard, ringed by a glimmering band of steel. 
When pressed, a whirling mass of reddish-orange energy shoots up 
from a small slot at the top in the shape of a serrated blade. 
The light is bright enough to illuminate anything nearby it and 
the currents of energy that shape it so strong that it makes the 
blade a solid, luminescent force. When activate small ripples of 
blue often arch over the handle of the knife, playing patterns 
over the hand of the one who holds it.

   Made from a heavy black metal this baton has a slightly 
concave shape, bulging out at the top where the majority of its 
weight is located. At the very bottom of the baton rests a small 
button ringed in a glimmering band of steel. When pressed small 
rivers of reddish-orange energy burst out to stream in even 
intervals along the shape of the baton, converging at the top 
like a mass of spiderwebs and discharging with a crack and a 
potentially painful shock when touched to something.

A luminescent spear floats in the air.~
   Made from a metal so smooth and dark it looks similar to 
polished stone, the long handle of this spear is wrapped within 
some type of synthetic material around its middle. At the top of 
the handle is a small button ringed with silver. When pressed, a 
soft humming noise begins to fill the air. It grows louder until 
trickles of reddish-orange pour out of the top of the handle and 
spread out into a single direction to form a blade that curve 
thickly at the tip. The movement of the energy remains constant 
and visible, passing by only to return again, creating a solid 
mass to the sleek blade.

sword crude metal pipe serrated flattened METAL~
a crude metal pipe sword~
A flattened, serrated pipe lies here, a crude sword.~
   This was once, almost noticeably, a pipe, and now it is a 
sword. Cut to a length of about four feet, the majority of this 
pipe has been pounded mostly flat; the hammer-strokes are rough 
and the pipe bends a little to the right. Where the pipe has 
been cut is a jagged point, and all down one edge it has been 
serrated, after a fashion - small, triangular chunks and bits 
have been cut out to make this crude weapon that much more 
vicious. The end of the pipe - the handle - has been wrapped 
around a few times with duct tape, so as to provide a better grip 
and make successful hits less jarring to the wielder.
