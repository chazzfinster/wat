a tall, portable, climate-controlled cabinet~
A tall, rectangular cabinet stands here, mounted upon wheels and whirring quietly.~
   Tall, sturdy polyprop walls make up the exterior of this cabinet, bearing a 
dull gray color. A transparent door is set into the top half of this cabinet's 
front, revealing a series of racks that hold a myriad of vials and tubes. A 
faint hum emerges from the climate control machinery that fills the cabinet's 
lower half.

algae lime-green slimy coloured ORGANIC~
a slimy, blue-green colored algae~
A slimy, blue-green colored algae grows here, dappling the walls and ground.~
   Only when its surroundings are completely motionless can one see that this 
lime-green coloured, slimy mess is alive and actively moving on its own, and 
not by the flow of the water surrounding it. It gives off an acrid smell, 
polluting the water surrounding it with a bitter taste, and what's worse, a 
burning sensation to anyone who would expose their skin to it. There is quite 
a bit of the stuff, and it would be next to impossible to move without damaging 
it unless some kind of tool were used. Oddly, every now and then it gives off 
a little pulse of dull green light that would barely illuminate even the 
darkest of shadows.
