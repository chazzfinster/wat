altar bloody OTHER~
a bloody altar~
A bloody altar hunkers ominously in the back of the chamber.~
   Constructed of various materials ranging from melted plastic 
to metal, stone and even a few skulls and bones which have been 
sunken into it, this macabre altar carries a rigid, squat shape. 
Carvings and corroded paint decorate it, giving testament to its 
age and which depict various, wildly formed figures and symbols. 
Atop its flat surface, this shrine-like structure carries a wide 
offering bowl, more often than not filled with with pieces of 
organic matter and crusted with dried blood. More blood annoints 
the thing in dribbles and splotches, in some places left to dry, 
in others, painted with the sweep of hands into patterns that 
obscure the natural lines underneath. Other objects litter its 
surface as well: bits of wire and shiny pieces of metal, stones, 
and a shallow dish bearing a pierced, dome lid that acts as an 
incense burner. Lightening the doom and gloom of its appearance, 
a couple of dried flowers and some leaves also sit on its 
surface, along with a number of eerily shaped statuettes.
