paste thick tube OTHER~
a thick tube of paste~
A thick tube of paste lies on the ground.~
   Composed of a semi-solid round tube of brown matter, this meal 
is meant to be eaten straight from its thin wrapper. The texture 
of the paste is gritty and tough despite its malleable state. 
The material that wraps it clings to itself allowing it to be 
easily resealed. Also, upon its side is stamped a serial number 
that has long since faded.

A large sack of curly cheese puffs tilts to the side here.~
   This clear, synthetic polymer sack contains a snack that 
resembles puffy orange caterpillars curled this way and that. A 
generic gold and red label simply proclaims the product to be 
'Chees-O Puffs'. Arrayed at the bottom of the bag, bright orange 
cheese powder gather together as if they are attending a 
convention.

completely dated. The mints themselves measure approximately a 
quarter of an inch long and sport a pale blue sugar coating.

Underneath the prominent pale yellow sticker sporting the cone, 
the smaller label reads '$lowbrand Ice Cream Substitute'.

raw.

a bare spider carcass~
The carcass of a spider has been left here, white-flesh showing.~
   This is the ruined carcass of a spider - given the vicious 
damage it has taken, its exoskeleton is shattered in dozens of 
places, globules of white flesh revealed through the damage. The 
extremities are badly damaged, and all this is now good for is to 
be recycled at the Firebreathers.

a self-contained growing tray brimming with growing mushrooms~
A self-contained growing tray sits here, brimming with growing mushrooms.~
   About the size of a banquet table, this free-standing tray has a depth of 
three feet, a neutral growing medium having been thickly layered within. The 
medium has the consistency of a thick gel and retains a faint pale peach hue. 
Tubes visibly snake into the tray from a complex set of pipes hooked beneath 
the table and constantly mist the highly absorbent surface of the medium, 
keeping it moist and surface-fluid. A height-adjustable array of grow lights 
hooks up and over the table, born on a firmly crafted metallic arm, a plug 
dangling behind the contraption. Sprouting from a thick metallic arm along the 
left side of the growing station is a small computerized console. The console, 
complete with readout, offers up-to-date information on the workings of the 
machine, as well as the status of those items being grown within. A small 
funnel-topped tube emerges from the right edge of the tray, the other side 
delving within the medium in a spiderweb of delicate connected tubing 
stretching the entire length. It seems to have been planted with mushroom 
spores, the tray already brimming with dozens of spindly fungi stalks.
