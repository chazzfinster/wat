   This is the hard upper-torso unit, or "HUT-Unit" of a space 
suit. It has been made out of a surprisingly light, flexible 
composite plastic resembling fibreglass, finished in black. The

connections for arm pieces and an angular helmet connection. 
There is a mounting bracket on the back for a primary life 
support system module, and several smaller mounting brackets on 
the front for instrumentation and display panels. This 
particular unit has a bellowed shoulder unit, to allow ease of 
donning the suit. On the shoulder unit is the ship's insignia: a 
phoenix, fiery wings encircling a gray sphere.

insulating, while the weave pulls moisture from the body and

A matte black plastic collar sits here, vibrating slightly.~
   This collar is, for the most part, a simple strip of 
high-grade polyprop formed into a band. Where it deviates from 
this simple design is just beside a simple, size-adjustable 
clasp, where sits a small box. Under close inspection, that 
small object seems to hum, and vibrate, from some inner-workings. 
To those with more sensitive ears, a certain extremely 
high-pitched wine might be audible. Conspiciously, the object's 
only decoration is a small GC stamped into the box.
