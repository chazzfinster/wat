a coiled, flat disc-like object~
A coiled, flat disc-like object lies here.~
   This object resembles an especially narrowing coil about half 
a metre long that can easily be compressed down into a disc 
shape. Its surface, covered in a reflective black epoxy, reveals 
a striated arrangement of darker ebony lines that stretch from 
the circumference to the centre of the coil. The flexible metal 
that the coil is made of absorbs heat readily and has the 
inscription, "SER-239-HM3" etched into the surface, circling 
around the centre of the disc.
