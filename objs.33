rifle RPT_Jaunt plastic assault byChelicerae PLASTIC~
a short, odd-looking assault rifle~
An odd-looking assault rifle with a shortened barrel has fallen here.~
   This rifle has a distinctly odd look to it. It is uniformly a 
matte black in color, even the magazine. The barrel is several 
inches shorter than is usual in such weapons, and seems to be 
thicker than the diameter of the small bore requires. The butt 
of the stock is molded into a triangle with the interior cut out. 
A magazine curves toward the muzzle from in front of a pistol 
grip and trigger. 

Once this weapon is picked up, the reason for its oddness becomes 
obvious, for it is molded completely of plastic. It is very 
lightweight, and despite its composition has a sinister, lethal 
look to it.

a thick helmet with a white camouflage cover~
A thick military helmet with a white camouflage cover lies here.~
   This helmet covers the head down to the brow in front. It 
curves downward along the temple to cover nearly the entire ear, 
bulging a bit to avoid interference with hearing as much as 
possible, and continues around the base of the skull where a 
pouch containing a ceramic shield hangs to cover the nape of the 
neck.. Several pads inside the helment provide some comfort, and 
a system of straps travel between a chin-cup and four points of 
connection on the helmet. In the front center is a white plastic 
plate fitted with electronic and mechanical connectors for 
various devices which might be worn on the head. A night vision 
monocle can be flipped down from the rim of the helmet before the 
right eye. A white and grey camouflage cover masks the basic 
green material.

rifle RPT_JAUNT carbine white assault byChelicerae METAL~
a white and grey camouflaged carbine in basic infantry configuration~
A white and grey camouflaged carbine has been left here.~
   This carbine is a modular weapon that can be configured to 
suit several jobs, and is now set up for use as a basic assault 
rifle. The barrel features a bayonet lug just before a vented 
polymer handguard that wraps around the rest of the barrel. A 
sturdy handle for carrying arcs from the top of the handguard to 
the pistol-grip receiver, where a tiny computer in the stock 
delivers various firing information to a red-dot sight atop the 
receiver. A slightly curved magazine inserted in front of the 
trigger has the capacity to hold thirty rounds of caseless 5.56mm 
ammunition. Above the trigger housing is a three-position switch 
that rotates to select automatic, semi-automatic, and burst modes 
of fire. The butt of the stock is adjustable to accomodate each 
soldier's armlength. In the very front of the handguard is a 
twistlock for mounting a bayonet. All plastic and the rifle 
sling is camouflaged with white and ghostly grey blotches, and 
the small amount of visible metal is a matte black. 

You can FIX a BAYONET to this rifle. After you CHECK the RIFLE 
to see if you need more ammunition, you can RELOAD the RIFLE. 
SELECT BURST or SEMI to fire four or one rounds at a single 
squeeze of the trigger. CHECK SELECTOR to see which position the 
switch is in. SHOOT <target> (ooc - make sure of your target) to 
fire the rifle.

rifle RPT_JAUNT bayonet carbine white assault byChelicerae METAL~
a white military carbine with a fixed bayonet~
A white military carbine fixed with a bayonet has been abandoned here.~
   This carbine is a modular weapon that can be configured to 
suit several jobs, and is now set up for use as a basic assault 
rifle. A bayonet has been fixed to the barrel before a vented 
polymer handguard that wraps around the rest of the barrel. A 
sturdy handle for carrying arcs from the top of the handguard to 
the pistol-grip receiver, where a tiny computer in the stock 
delivers various firing information to a red-dot sight atop the 
receiver. A slightly curved magazine inserted in front of the 
trigger has the capacity to hold thirty rounds of caseless 5.56mm 
ammunition. Above the trigger housing is a three-position switch 
that rotates to select automatic, semi-automatic, and burst modes 
of fire. The butt of the stock is adjustable to accomodate each 
soldier's armlength. In the very front of the handguard is a 
twistlock for mounting a bayonet. All plastic and the rifle 
sling is camouflaged with white and ghostly grey blotches, and 
the small amount of visible metal is a matte black. 

You can UNFIX the BAYONET, or RELOAD the RIFLE.

A white and grey camouflaged sniper rifle with fixed bayonet has been left here.~
   This bolt-action rifle is a modular weapon that can be 
configured to suit several jobs, and is now set up for use as a 
sniper rifle. The integral bipod can be flipped down from the 
vented handguard that wraps around the rear of the long barrel, 
and a bayonet has been affixed to the bayonet lug near the 
muzzle. A sturdy handle for carrying arcs from the top of the 
handguard to the pistol-grip receiver, where a ballistic computer 
in the stock delivers various firing information to a large scope 
atop the receiver. A slightly curved magazine inserted in front 
of the trigger has the capacity to hold thirty rounds of caseless 
5.56mm ammunition. All plastic and the rifle sling is 
camouflaged with white and ghostly grey blotches, and any visible 
metal is matte black.
