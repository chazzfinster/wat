a $camocolor helmet with a reflective visor~
A $camocolor helmet with a reflective, pull-down visor lies here.~
   This helmet has been constructed of a single piece of 
composite material, is incredibly durable, strong, and fairly 
flexible. It is a $camocolor in colour, entirely unglossy, and has 
a single pull-down visor that reflects light and obscures much of 
the wearer's face when lowered.

a bent, metal lunchtray~
A bent metal lunchtray sits here, crooked.~
   It is a simple lunchtray, manufactured out of stainless steel. 
Roughly two feet wide and a foot long. Someone has made a crude 
handle out of a tin can and attached it to the shield as well as 
a strap out of duct tape. It could clearly be used as a crude 
shield.

shield large scrap iron METAL~
a large, scrap-iron shield~
A large, scrap-iron shield lies here.~
   While clearly a shield, this object has been crudely put 
together with at least three different chunks of metal. It does, 
however, appear to get the job done - two chunks of metal are 
welded into a vaguely circular shape while another has been 
sautered onto the back of the shield as a handle. The shield is 
rather large at that, roughly four feet in diameter (and nearly 
five in some parts). It is crude and shoddy, but effective 
enough.

shield desktop crude tower METAL~
a crude tower shield made from a desktop~
A crude tower shield lies here, contructed from a desktop.~
   This shield used to be an office desktop - it's roughly four 
feet long and was, at one point, polished and glossy. Some of 
that polish and gloss still remains, but the rest has been 
dented, scratched, and chipped. As much of the former desk as 
was possible has been stripped away to lighten the hunk of metal, 
like the drawers and legs. A pair of handles has been bolted to 
the back, to provide a grip and better handling.

A shield made out of steel fan-blades is here.~
   Using steel fan-blades a resourceful person has managed to 
create a large, heavy shield. The five fan-blades have been 
screwed together to create the shield while an old tin can has 
been opened, bent and attaced to the inside to act as a handle. 
Whoever made this shield has even gone so far as to wrap duct 
tape together and screw it onto the shield to create a strap. It 
may be large and bulky, but it seems like it would do a good job 
acting as a shield.

A hunk of scrap metal has been hammered flat and screwed onto the 
blades to keep it all together. Forming a crude handle is a 
squeezed together empty tin can and some duct tape form a strap. 
All in all a fairly heavy, ugly piece and it covers a person's 
forearm and not much more but surely it does a decent job at 
acting as a large buckler.

are long, ending just before the hands of most wearers. The 
cuffs have been shorn off, and the shirt has been modified into a 
crude piece of armor. Cloth padding has been sewn over most of 
the front - mainly over where internal organs would be - and also 
on the back, along the shoulder blades and across the lower back. 
Padding has also been sewn along the arms, into the sleeves.

A luminescent shield floats in the air.~
   The material that this footlong shield is made from is 
completely translucent save for small reddish veins that populate 
its expanse like hairline cracks. Extremely thin and almost 
delicate in appearance, it weighs almost next to nothing with a 
single metal handle located on the back, a small button sitting 
visible there. When pressed, visible threads of energy surge out 
from the shield, curling over the forearm and elbow of its user. 
Seemingly intangible, the energy creates a protective force that 
keeps away blows to this part of the body, some of the reddish 
tendrils expanding to curl about the shield itself.

a sawed canteen hat~
A canteen hat lies here, a hole sawed in the middle.~
   What used to be a canteen has been turned into a crude hat. A 
hole has been sawed into one side of it, right around the edge, 
and a lump of padding has been forcibly shoved into said hole. 
While incredibly crude and mostly rediculous, the thick plastic 
would provide at least some protection to the wearer's dome.

a pounded, tin-cup helmet~
A pounded, tin-cup helmet lies here.~
   Something like four tin cups have been pounded into shape and 
bolted together then stuffed with padding to make a crude helmet. 
The creator seems to have gone all-out in the item's construction 
- it resembles a hat, complete with a bill and two crude 
ear-flaps. Overall, while not particularly stylish, it appears 
as if it would provide profficient protection against assault to 
the cranium.

A banded, $camocolor1 combat helm is here.~
   Numerous layers of polymer-hardened $polymesh have been fused together to 
form this hardened combat helm before having being treated with some kind of 
strengthening resin and marked with a $camocolor camouflage pattern. The 
untreated polymesh interior allows the helmet to sit comfortably atop of one's 
head. In addition, numerous geometric bands of hardened plastic run across the 
helmet, adding additional strength and protection. When properly worn, the 
helmet covers the forehead before sloping down to conceal the ears and back of 
the head. A hard plastic chin strap dangles from the mesh.

   When glanced inside, this pair of boots seems to be dyed $color0, and is 
made out of $polymesh1. This isn't apparant from the outside, however, as 
chitinous plates have been stitched firmly into place on every inch of the 
outer reaches. Without straps or buckles, these boots would be difficult to 
put on or remove, but the cloth on the inside is thick and makes them somewhat 
comfortable to wear. Each of the chitin plates is segmented, and only the 
piece at the front of the toes fails to overlap another. The bottom of the 
boots are exposed and allow for an even walk.
