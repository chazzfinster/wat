spork plastic PLASTIC~
a plastic spork~
A plastic spork has been cast aside.~
   This plastic utensil is the epitome of utensil engineering. A 
spoon and a fork rolled all into one, it is made to fit 
comfortably into a person's hand, allowing the easy eating of 
liquids or solids. Made of cheap plastic, the utensil is in all 
ways useless except for when being employed in the eating 
process.

a pile of scattered photographs~
A pile of photographs have been scattered here.~
   A good number of small photographs lie scattered in a heap, 
the majority of them ill-framed and poorly shot, though some are 
surprisingly good and almost all the smiles are sincere. Among 
the photographs are the following shots:

#2-#0 A neatly-made bunk bed being danced upon by #5an oversized, tattooed, no-necked guy#0. Laughing up at the ridiculously posing man is #5a serpentine woman with multi-coloured dreadlocks#0 and a #5lean, green-eyed man with sable locks#0. Off to the side, only half in the frame, stands #5a toned, dreadlocked young arab man#0, looking non-plussed.

#2-#0 A room's dark interior, the only light spilling in from twinkling stars that shine through a massive hole in the room's wall. This photo appears less yellowed around the edges than those that follow.

#2-#0 A blurry shot of #5a half-naked, burn-scarred, one-eyed man#0 rushing past #5a short young man with dark hair#0, washed out by a strong flash.

#2-#0 In a field of green before a section of the outer ship, which conceivably stretches far beyond the boundaries of the picture, #5a pale-skinned man with blonde dreadlocks#0 and #5a slender woman with dark, auburn hair#0 stand shoulder to shoulder, grinning wickedly for the camera. Below this picture is scrawled a message in faded black ink: #6Tom and Rose, Kickin' Ass Since '69#0

A glossy magazine lies here, filled with objectionable content.~
   This glossy magazine has a large, naked, fleshy derriere on 
its cover, and the word ANALOG written in red, blocky boldface. 
The contents of the magazine are no less subtle than the cover: 
large, graphic, naked - graphically naked - men and women in 
various poses, not all even erotic or appealling. Curiously, 
what few articles this magazine has tucked in away under all the 
expressive nudity seem to focus around rockets, aliens, and ray 
guns.

The mummified corpse of a young man sits, propped up against a wall.~
   This mummified corpse appears to have once been a young man. 
Parts of him have sloughed off, but otherwise he has been 
surprisingly well-preserved given the dampness of the room - his 
paper-thin skin has been drawn back and all bones jut obscenely, 
giving this corpse a macabre appearance. He looks incredibly 
fragile; any jostling might completely pull him apart.

#5An older woman with a narrow frame#0 is here, practicing with a weapon.~
   Pronounced wrinkles give this woman a permanantly furrowed 
brow. The wrinkles subtly touch the rest of her pale face, 
becoming exaggerated whenever she frowns or narows her eyes and 
giving light dashes of age to her features. Her short-cropped 
hair is dark black, with the occasional grey streak. A lanky 
frame gives her a narrow look, and her skin is marred by 
liver-spots and a burn marks.

red bordered in yellow on a black background. The pack bears the 
traditional Howitzers packaging: A large bullet bearing a toothy

a rusty water pump~
A rusty water pump is here surrounded by a small puddle.~
   The once-bright, blue paint has been flaked and chipped off of 
this water supply, exposing the rusting metal beneath. It is an 
old style of pump, a lever used to hand-pump the water to the 
surface. It leaks quite a bit after use, a perpetual water 
puddle on the ground around it.

a pair of thin, black glasses with a pliable frame~
A pair of thin, black glasses has been deposited nearby.~
   Made of a highly pliable plastic polymer, this pair of glasses 
has been designed to handle abuse. The arms of the spectacles 
have seamlessly sheathed joints that hide the hinge underneath. 
Flecks of reflective black paint have already begun to chip off 
the surface of the frame, exposing a dull, metallic grey. The 
frame resembles an upside-down trapezoid with rounded edges, 
giving them a blockish appearance. Along the top of the left 
arm, a small black dial with tiny rivulets can be rotated to 
focus the lens to any desired prescription. The glass lenses 
appear to reflect different amounts of light over any time 
period, adjusting instantaneously to environmental changes in 
visibility.

a steel trash chute~
A steel trash chute is set into the starboard wall, near the blastdoor.~
   This steel trash-chute is of solid design and appears to be 
completely functional, if a bit clunky in appearance. A yellowed 
sticker giving instructions runs the width of the device on its 
outer lid. Its description of using the chute is simple enough, 
stating to open the lid downward, like you might an oven, and 
place any disposable materials inside to be launched out into 
space when you press the red button on the device's side. There 
is a smooth, rounded handle at the top of the lid with a torn 
rubber grip running around its metallic shaft to simplify the 
disposal of trash even further. 

You could #6LAUNCH#0 your #6TRASH#0 into space with this.

The pages are gold-leafed, faded, and yellow from age, though the

   Where there was once perhaps a fine mural occupying one of the 
large walls in this part of Grungetown, the harsh sunlight and 
freezing nights have ruined it, leaving but faint traces of 
shapes you beyond any easy recognition. Chips of flaking spray 
paint have gathered at the base of the mural.

A tight braid-ring of woven wispy blonde hair lies here.~
This is a simple, short braided length of wispy blonde hair that tightly knots into a finger-sized circle on one side, with the loose excess untrimmed and trailing a few inches further. It's fitted only for a fairly slender finger, and even there it would make for quite a tight fit.

A large, reflectively blackened crater mars the landscape.~
   This crater has been shorn from the landscape, extending almost twenty 
meters across. Dipping down only a few meters into the surface, whatever may 
have been here before has now been completely destroyed. The surface within 
the crater is a web of black, shattered glass that glints in either sunlight or 
starlight. Sand has blown away from the surface in places, showing a strange 
slab of steel hidden beneath the ground here. It might be a hatch of some 
kind.

a large, ocean blue metallic pod~
A large, ocean blue metallic pod sits here, embedded in the street.~
   Broad enough to fit half a dozen figures abreast, and about ten feet tall, 
this large pod looks like a comically oversized bullet, which has pierced the 
flesh of the pavement and littered its surroundings with debris. It is made of 
metallic hexagonal tiles, strangely sleek and streamlined in an otherworldly 
way, looking starkly out of place among its surroundings. Scrapes and dents 
mar the surface, but the ocean blue metal shell has otherwise survived its 
impact. Embossed on the shell are slightly raised wavy patterns of a nautical 
characteristic running lengthwhise from top to bottom, and a seamless panel 
hatch has opened in one side to reveal rows of harnesses.

a desert grey, metal flush door~
Half-buried under obscuring mounds of moon sand is a desert grey, metal flush door.~
   About eight feet wide and just as many tall, this door is 
sunken into the surrounding lunar desert. It is made of 
lightly-textured metal without any notable indentions, other 
markings, or means of opened. The color on the outside is a 
layer of desert grey paint, and when partially buried it is 
especially difficult to spot unless one is right on top of it. 
When opening it swings up and outwards, the moon dust sliding off 
and away from the space below to rejoin the rest of the grey 
landscape.

a fluid-filled, polyprop canister housing a pair of eyeballs~
Sitting here is a clear, polyprop canister filled with fluid and a floating pair of eyeballs.~
   Basically a cylinder of clear polyprop, this canister has a 
lid that locks on top with a series of wires and circuits woven 
through it. The interior is filled with a colorless liquid, and 
houses a matching pair of eyeballs with bright, cerulean irises. 
When it's shaken they bob somewhat, and leer sightlessly in 
whatever direction they happen to be facing. A webbing of blood 
vessels traces through the sclera, and attaches to the trailing 
optical nerves which slither to the bottom of the canister.

In the plaza's center a rectangular pillar to a height of five feet, constructed of a nickel-plated titon alloy. Two legs rise from the pillar's top, showing crisp definition until coming to the man's mid-thigh, at which the statue suddenly ends in a twisted mass of shattered metal. A powerful explosion of some kind has clearly demolished the statue, and the rest of the man's form is scattered about the immediate area, resting on or nearby the benches that ring the pillar.

computer destroyed xECODOME PLASTIC~

A large, partly-destroyed computer lies here.~
   Though this computer appears quite old and damaged, it was clearly of a very 
high-quality design. Of technical rather than personal use, most of the 
computer's form consists of a four foot high, three foot wide computing tour. 
On the upper quarter of the tower an interaction screen has been built in, only 
the frame of which remains at this point. The tower itself has been torn open 
by something, revealing the components within. 

Visible upon inspection is a wide, delicate computer chip, which seems to be 
carefully bolted onto the frame, with several wires running into it. Though 
clearly difficult to remove, a skilled electrician might be able to #6GATHER#0 
the chip.

The devastated corpse of a monk is here, torn apart gruesomely.~
   This man was once an embodiment of Mandiran imagery, and much of his 
appearance is still iconic in death. His left arm and right leg are entirely 
missing, and his bloodied garments are shredded apart to reveal the horrific 
state of his body. An expression of terror is set deeply into his features, 
only deepened by a rough hole that marks where his right eye would normally 
reside. A wispy, long beard protrudes from his chin, much of the 
normally-whitish hair bearing the blackish tinge of dried blood.

The corpse of a monk is here, joints locked in a kneeling position.~
   This man is clad in a simple brown robe, the bottom of which has stained a 
sickly, dark shade due to his kneeling position upon the center of the temple 
floor. Though his body is locked upright to keep the man from falling over, a 
massive hole resides within the center of his chest, allowing for a 
mostly-unobstructed view through the monk. Fragments of rib stick outward from 
the torn robe, mimicking the shape of teeth closing in upon the gruesome 
opening. His shaven head is downturned, chin planted against his collarbone. 
For any who would dare to come close enough, his face bears an unnaturally 
serene and prepared expression which is only slightly warped by the duration of 
time since his death.

an unfinished, $color bass guitar~
An unfinished, $color bass guitar lies here.~
   A hollow frame, this bass guitar is made of plastic that has been painted 
$color. The frame has been nearly completed, and the body contains the 
framework of the electronics that will allow the sound it will eventually 
produce to be amplified. The guitar hasn't been strung, and is missing several 
components to allow it to be so.

a dismembered grey-skinned tentacle~
A heavy length of tentacle lays here, disembodied and twitching.~
   Though lacking it's serpentine movement, this heavy appendage still twithes 
sporadically, writhing about in it's own viscous leavings. The dismembered 
whole ears a rank scent that clings to it's sulphur phumes. It's mangled 
grey-green flesh has a variety of damages, evidence of what it eventually 
succumbed to.
