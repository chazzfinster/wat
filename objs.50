a black keycard with photo identification~
A black keycard with photo identification lies here, forlorn.~
   This small, black photo-identification keycard is rectangular 
in shape and made entirely out of a plastic alloy. In the upper 
lefthand corner is a small photo of an attractive middle-aged man 
with a confident smile and neatly-groomed gray hair. Beneath the 
photo are the words, "Zager Evans, M.D., Chief of Surgery". 
There is a crest in the background of the keycard, when it is 
turned a certain way in the light, showing a giant bird wrapping 
its wings around a gray sphere. On the back of the card is a 
magnetic strip, to be utilized with a scanner.

of the bathroom and rises just short of chest-high. A steel 
washbasin has been set centered in it, and pipes run from it 
(hidden away within the counter itself) to the floor. It has a 
flaring, graceful steel faucet, two handles for adjusting water 
temperature, and two drawers at either end of it.

A king-sized bed with a white comforter stands in the center of the room.~
   A rarity in space, this king-sized bed has been placed center 
in the as equally excessive room, and made up with fine linen and 
a downy-stuffed comforter. Curiously enough, the fabric appears 
to be attached to the bed in some way as to render it impossible 
to remove from the bed without ripping, or cutting: it is as much 
a part of the bed as the mattress is, and it has all been 
soldered to the floor in some fashion, preventing it from moving.

A squat, stained plastic desk dominates this small office.~
   This sturdy desk is squat and large, almost frog-like, and 
takes up most of the space in the small room. It is made 
entirely of darkly stained plastic, looks to have been elegantly 
constructed, and has brass trim and drawer knobs. A chair has 
been drawn up to either side of it, the more expensive of the two 
similar in many ways to an old, leather wingback.

spacesuit discoloured hanging corpse xAnaisx xSOUP_IN_A_SUITx OTHER~
a hanging, discoloured spacesuit, heavy with something~
A discoloured spacesuit dangles from a rope tied about its collared neck.~
   At first glance, this spacesuit looks merely old and ill-used. 
It has been completely assembled, all parts clasped and clipped 
into place and its helmet fastened, bolted to its collared neck. 
It resembles in many ways a human suicide: hanging from a noose 
tied to the showerhead in the ceiling, dangling obscenely inches 
off the floor. On closer examination, however, it becomes 
macabrely obvious that, far from just resembling a suicide, it is 
in fact one - pressed up against the faceplate of its helmet are 
the remains of a mummifying human face, its teeth jutting and 
yellow. Most tissue, with exception of parts of the face and 
forehead, has sluiced away and pools in a congealed mass in the 
boots and legs of the spacesuit. Most of the smell, however, is 
contained within the sealed spacesuit.

A small square table of shiny $color0 plastic sits here.~
This square $color table is made of hard plastic, and stands to the height of an average man's waist. Supported by black metal bars that expand into wide bell-like feet, it is stable and utilitarian. It is not particularly large, and seats only one person per side. The only source of ornamentation are lifted edge-frames, etched with ivory-white vines. Four plastic black chairs flank each side of the table.

guitar scrap small handmade OTHER~
a small handmade scrap guitar~
A small handmade scrap guitar rests here.~
   This makeshift instrument seems to be composed of a small, 
plastic computer shell that serves as a body attached to a curved 
metal fan blade that acts as a neck. Dull metal wire has been 
firmly attached to the body and at various places long the neck 
as strings. A small piece of scrap metal, held in place by the 
tension of the strings, serves as a bridge holding the strings a 
short distance above the body and neck. The effect of plucking 
the strings is twangy and loud, but pressing along the neck does 
allow for the manipulation of the sound it can produce. 

If your character knows how to play guitar, you may type #6PLAY 
STYLE#0 for further syntax.

a large security monitor and console~
Set into the starboard wall is a large security monitor and console.~
   This widescreen monitor is split into six different sections, 
each meant to show a security point-of-view on a different 
section of the ship. The console attached to the monitor has 
many flickering lights and buttons, and a section on its right 
side with a label that suggests that it is meant to be used in 
remotely controlling some sort of probe droid.

xFoodMachineOfflinex massive boxy apparatus device tubing METAL xStaphx~
a massive, boxy apparatus crawling with tubing~
A massive, boxy apparatus crawling with tubing sits here, offline.~
   Composed primarily of a large, rectangular box made of some 
alloy with an almost whitish sheen to it, this massive piece of 
machinery has an evident directional flow to its parts. From the 
front, its left hand side reveals a thick blastdoor roughly three 
feet in height and width, frozen in mid-closure. The cavity 
behind the blastdoor extends roughly six feet into the machine, 
barely a quarter of its entire length. The rest of the 
rectangular device is riddled with tubes that snake along the 
exterior of the machine, their translucent interiors exposing 
liquids of various colours and homogeneities that seem to be 
suspended due to some blockage in the flow. 


   From the right hand side of the machine protrude roughly forty 
tiny translucent tubes that then run down the side of the main 
rectangular mass of the apparatus. The fluids contained within 
these tubes employ a varied palette of colours and seem to feed 
into one centralized box at the base of the machine. From this 
box, there are three different shaped flaps cut into the base 
that seem to feed into a conveyor belt. At various points along 
this belt are offshoots where the rations are stacked and 
organized by several sets of tiny mechanical arms with flippers 
that seem to attract the rations magnetically at very close 
range. All of this associated conveying and stacking equipment 
is, like the rest of the device, frozen in stasis. 


   Out in front of the main box of the apparatus stands a small 
panel with a broad touch screen, where red signals and 
abbreviations for alarm codes flash incessantly on the screen.

a massive, boxy apparatus crawling with translucent tubing~
A massive, boxy apparatus with brightly lit translucent tubing is here.~
   Composed primarily of a large, rectangular box made of some 
alloy with an almost whitish sheen to it, this massive piece of 
machinery has an evident directional flow to its parts. From the 
front, its left hand side reveals a thick blastdoor roughly three 
feet in height and width, gaping open to expose metallic 
drip-racks over a sieved funnel at the bottom of the cavity. 
This hollow interior extends roughly six feet into the machine, 
barely a quarter of its entire length. The rest of the 
rectangular device is riddled with tubes that snake along the 
exterior of the machine, their translucent interiors exposing 
liquids of various colours and homogeneities. These liquids flow 
forward and back in cycles that last several seconds, the process 
instigating a light splashing from the turbulence. 


   Out of the right hand side of the machine protrude roughly 
forty tiny translucent tubes that then run down the side of the 
main rectangular mass of the apparatus. The fluids contained 
within these tubes employ a varied palette of colours and seem to 
feed into one centralized box at the base of the machine, flow 
cycling much like the other tubes. From this box, there are 
three different shaped flaps cut into the base that seem to feed 
into a conveyor belt. At various points along this belt are 
offshoots where the rations are stacked and organized by several 
sets of tiny mechanical arms with flippers that seem to attract 
the rations magnetically at very close range. All of this 
associated conveying and stacking equipment is also obviously 
programmed on some cycle, with the flippers rotating spastically, 
as if testing their own functionality. 


   Extruding from the main box of the apparatus is a small panel 
with a broad touch screen, where a series of fluxing green lines 
that protrude from a circular symbol in the centre.

A massive, boxy apparatus is here, churning out rations from its base.~
   Composed primarily of a large, rectangular box made of some 
alloy with an almost whitish sheen to it, this massive piece of 
machinery has an evident directional flow to its parts. From the 
front, its left hand side reveals a thick blastdoor roughly three 
feet in height and width, frozen in mid-closure. The cavity 
behind the blastdoor extends roughly six feet into the machine, 
barely a quarter of its entire length. The rest of the 
rectangular device is riddled with tubes that snake along the 
exterior of the machine, their translucent interiors exposing 
liquids of various colours and homogeneities that are flowing 
rapidly against the faint lighting in the tubes. 


   From the right hand side of the machine protrude roughly forty 
tiny tubes that then run down the side of the main rectangular 
mass of the apparatus. The fluids contained within these tubes 
employ a varied palette of colours and seem to feed into one 
centralized box at the base of the machine. From this box, 
rations in bar, tube and tin form shoot from tiny cavities and 
are carried along a conveyer belt at floor level. At various 
points along this belt are offshoots where the rations are 
stacked and organized by several sets of tiny mechanical arms 
with flippers that seem to attract the rations magnetically at 
very close range. All of this associated conveying and stacking 
equipment moves busily, stacking rations at a surprising pace. 


   Out in front of the main box of the apparatus stands a small 
panel with a broad touch screen, where a circle at the centre of 
the screen pulses rhythmically with wavelike projections 
smoothing about its diameter.

virtually laying in an invisible curtain over the area. Greenish-brown sludge 
and silk netting encompass anything nearby, stretching out to coccoon corpses 
of various origins: humans, barkers, shredders, and other things that might be 
found int he Lunar environment. More are heaped together in small, neat 
pyramids as if systematically put there. Spreading out from the thicker areas 
a semi-liquid, sticky slime spreads and clings to feet.

lefthand corner is a small photo of an attractive man with a thin 
smile and clean brunette hair. Beneath the photo are the words, 
"Mal Reynolds - Propery Quartermaster". There is a crest in the 
background of the keycard, when it is turned a certain way in the 
light, showing a giant bird wrapping its wings around a gray 
sphere. On the back of the card is a magnetic strip, to be 
utilized with a scanner.

a rickety, steel access ladder~
A rickety, steel access ladder has been bolted to the wall.~
   This rickety access ladder has been bolted to the wall here, allowing access 
up and down the elevator shaft. While at one time it was undoubtedly sturdy, 
it has long since fallen into serious disrepair - several steps are missing, 
others seem much too short to allow for solid footing, and several bolts appear 
to be screwed loose. All in all, not a good place to linger. 

You can use this to #6CLIMB UP#0 or #6CLIMB DOWN#0.

being rather plush and soft, stuffed with a layer of a downy

scratches and tears cover it, but does little to affect the 
presence of two great cat-like ears that have been worked onto 
the top of it.

   The infinite darkness of space spreads out beyond the 
nanocomposite viewport, dotted with a panoply of differently 
coloured points of light. A massive planet looms immediate in 
the left side of your vision, its pale blue-green surface 
interrupted with several alabaster bands that wrap around its 
circumference. Only barely visible against the black of the void 
are several thin, white bands that form rings around the planet 
and fade quickly nearest the planet. The upper hemisphere of 
your vision is filled with an array of stars shaded with the 
various hues that sit between white and yellow, with a large 
cluster of bright red stars conglomerated very closely together. 
Near the bottom portion of the window, an expanse of blue, orange

long, arm shape that fades toward the bottom right hand corner of 
the view. Just barely visible in distance is a bright yellow 
ball of light nearly two times the size of any other star in 
sight. A number of tiny spheres of rock and ice surround the 
planet, only visible when backgrounded by the distinctive colour 
of the planet. Although it is difficult to ascertain how many 
there might be, since some are indistinguisble from weather 
formations on the planet, they surely number more than twenty.

back of the panel has a single, rounded bump right at the centre, 
from which several differently coloured, pliable plastic tubes 
extend. All the tubes have been roughly severed, even hacked in 
some places, just about half a metre from their protrusion at the 
back of the panel.

a small mound of molten metal covered in congealed algae~
A small mound of molten metal covered in congealed algae is here.~
   This mound of metal looks like it has been moulded into a 
bucket shape by small amounts of molten alloys being poured in 
gradually building layers. Sitting in the top of the bucket 
shape is a thin, greenish layer of almost plant-like filaments 
that form an intermeshed network over a presumably hollow cavity 
in the mound. The network of filaments, which vaguely resembles 
algae, appears to be congealed and the tip of a corroding steel 
rod tinged with red protrudes from this algal mass. The surface 
of the congealed biological meshwork seems to be exuding streams 
of vapour from its darkest, densest segments. Haphazardly 
arranged around the nest itself are #2several red-tinged steel 
rods#0, untouched by the biological material.

bewildering manner. While the overall mass is mostly spherical, 
the tube splits in some locations, twisting into small fibres 
that reassemble elsewhere on the surface of the vessel. On the 
top of the vessel, the final tube is attached to a white plastic 
panel with a rubbery, inward-facing nipple-shaped opening that 
thins down severely as it enters the panel. The rear of the 
tangled mess of pipes is clamped to the wall, with a fat tube 
protruding from the main mass to attach further near the bass of 
the starboard wall.

A red control panel is mounted on a tripod in the centre of the room.~
   The surface of this control panel is coated in a shiny-red 
alloy that bears four green-glass display panels distributed two 
by two. The top panels, labelled "Sample Injection Rate" and 
"H2O Vapour Saturation" are accompanied by small, squishy 
circular finger pads that have hollow interiors that form around 
the tip of the index finger for control. The bottom panels lack 
any finger pads and are labelled, in the same bright yellow ink 
as their upper counterparts, "Temperature," and "Pressure". 
Three long metallic tubes, no thicker than a human finger and 
coloured the same red as the panel itself, extend down to form a 
tripod shape that has been soldered together and to the ground. 
A small finger pad sits alone in the centre of the panel with the 
word, "Vacuum" above.

A rotating platform that holds a smoothed cone-shape apparatus is here.~
   A seasoned scientist would be able to use the Pandora RXN 
Monitor for anything from simple dissolution of samples to 
fine-tuning thousands of environmental parameters in a reaction 
between two or many molecules. Essentially, it consists of a 
massive vat that contains millions of microlitre-sized vessels 
packed together. Systems of tubes feed and interconnect the 
vessels, supplying them with solvents. The machine will 
internally modify thousands of conditions using a complex system 
of algorithms that are simplified on the control panel to provide 
essential readouts and control of various factors. Laser-based 
technology allows fine-tuned measurement of reactions between 
individual molecules as large as proteins. The taxing nature of 
this kind of experimentation leaves no sample to output, but will 
give information about the types of interactions and how strong 
they are between single molecules.

a jackhammer-shaped piece of equipment~
A jackhammer-shaped piece of equipment with a touch panel.~
   Known simply as 'The Fist', this complex piece of machinery 
was built with the primary goal of reducing solids to less than 
solid states. Whatever the substance, the synthetic 
diamond-lattice spike within the machine can drive small amounts 
of solid compounds at high speeds, with many tons of pummelling 
strength that will reduce the solid to paste. From this design 
point forward, the machine's major internal component is a 
heating loop at the back of the chassis through which the crushed 
sample can be relayed and melted down, then analyzed for its 
atomic components using a variety of x-ray fluorescence beams and 
molten densometric capillaries. 3D electron tomography 
equipments blasts a variety of concentrated electron beams that 
can map surface structure of solids and even predict the 
arrangement of metal atoms in alloys. Most of the touch panel 
that controls this apparatus consists of dials that control 
various forces and temperatures, but the complex modeling 
software occupies a quarter of the screen with 3D grid shapes and 
maps of atomic arrangement.

PuriHive honeycomb formation columns METAL~
a honeycomb formation of vertical metal columns~
A honeycomb formation of vertical metal columns of various colours is here.~
   Built like a hive of vertically oriented columns arranged in 
honeycomb formations, this device forms a complex, machinated 
vasculature of coloured tubes carrying variety of 'vessel' tubes 
accompanied by 'feeder' tubes, the latter providing a broad 
variety of chemicals to fine-tune every variable that might 
induce change in the contents of the former. This device has the 
ability to concentrate specific components in a liquid solution, 
selectively remove solvents from a solution and replace them with 
others or separate the contents of an otherwise homogenous 
solution. The endless intricacies of manipulating single 
molecules require that much of the starting material be exhausted 
during the process, yielding only limited sample-sized 
quantities. This machine is controlled by a complex system of 
eight sliders that encompass various shifting parameters that are 
determined to be the most particularly influential to the 
reaction at hand. The user can select the parameters using vocal 
commands. The most frequently used parameters include column pH 
(acid/base), elution composition, resin composition (for 
separating components based on size or affinity for some 
compound/molecule), temperature and then static meters for 
pressure and flow rate are exhibited. The name of this device, 
printed along one of the foremost columns in tiny lettering, is 
the 'PuriHive'.

BioBarrel silvery barrel-shaped object hydraulic METAL~
a silvery barrel-shaped object mounted on a hydraulic arm~
A silvery barrel-shaped object mounted on a hydraulic arm is here.~
   The 'BioBarrel' is just that; a human-sized, barrel-shaped 
metallic object with a rotating arm that allows it to be hung 
sideways, terrarium style, or shaken vertically, like a liquid 
bioreactor (or fermentor vessel). There is no direct viewport 
into the barrel, since the actual biosphere vessel itself is not 
much larger than a fist. Well over ninety-five percent of the 
barrel's mass is made up of small vessels that control various 
gas concentrations, the liquid media/solid media and their 
composition, as well as systems of motors and manipulating arms 
that control shaking, vibrating and sliding motions in the 
biosphere barrel. This vessel can grow bacterial, fungal, 
mammalian and even, using a host system, some simple viruses. It 
should be noted that this machine functions over long spans of 
time. Typical runs take several days to process while the 
programming experiments with the most viable growing conditions 
for the entity at hand. At even then, the machine does not 
expend energy growing significant sums, but only small source 
amounts that can be used for further study. The injection and 
sample output nozzles are the only highly interactive parts of 
this machine; although parameters for the vessel's functioning 
can be modified manually, the programming is very well-equipped 
to deal with this manually. The complex part of operating this 
device comes in interpreting the results, known as biographs, 
which are depictions of the parameters known to cycle in a 
particular growth system. As a result, long graphs of sinusoidal 
lines need to be reviewed for any deviation from the set pattern 
for a particular meaning, if any.

Bioleye alabaster sphere orifice METAL~
an alabaster sphere with an orifice for a retractable padded board~
An alabaster sphere with an orifice for a retractable padded board is here.~
   Nearly reaching to the ceiling, this alabaster-painted 
spherical device has a circular opening with a long, padded bed 
protruding just beside a simple, milky white control panel. The 
board that slides in and out of the spherical apparatus can be 
rotated from the 'padding-up' side to a solid metallic side, 
which has a small sample dish the size of a fist carved into the 
metal. This device uses three methods to view samples; visible 
light (microscopy), X-ray diffraction (X-ray spectroscopy) and 
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (NMR or MRI). The first of these, 
light microscopy can be applied to cells, surfaces that need to 
be seen at high resolution or anything else that light can 
penetrate and provide definition to. The second is primarily 
used to detect the diffraction off repeating crystalline 
structures (most pure crystals are repeating units of some common 
shape within a defined 3D space) - this is for determining 
protein structures or any other crystallisable substance. 
Lastly, MRI can be used to verify brain patterns in a certain 
subject against programmed norms within the machine. Please 
note, this is not a full body scan and will not tell you the 
state of every organ in a person's body - this will aid in the 
detection of abnormal patterns of electrical activity in the 
brain. The interpretation of the data can be very complex and a 
seasoned scientist with a knowledge of the human biology along 
with chemistry should be able to interpret the complexity of some 
of the images, but most of the data interpretation is performed 
by the ChemTexion Mk2 via its uplink with this machine, labelled 
clearly as the "BiolEye" in blue lettering along the right hand 
side of its spherical mass.

An examination table underneath a flexible robotic arm is here.~
   This entire machine is shaped around a small table with 
retracting full-body manacles of white that wrap across the 
chest, waist and thigh. Within each manacle is a system of tiny 
needles and probes that penetrate the immediate epidermal layer 
around the forehead and scalp; lower abdominal; and the groin and 
buttocks. Furthermore, a tiny tube extends from the main mass of 
the machine - a giant arm that drapes over the patient. This 
tube can be attached to a major vein in order to sample the 
concentration of various components in the blood and inject minor 
amounts of certain solutions. Contained within the flexible arm 
are various sampling syringes and charge-dispensing electrodes 
for testing reflexes. The name, "PhysioDiagnostix" is appended 
to the side of the arm in bold purple lettering. A learned 
doctor would be vital for operating this piece of machinery and 
understanding the readout that appears on the stable base of the 
arm. This machine can sequence the genetic code of certain 
individuals and compare them against a present 'average human 
genome', while also investigating their haematological state for 
abnormalities. This machine is meant for investigating 
long-standing medical issues that cannot immediately be resolved 
by surgery.

arrow with a point that comes up to the middle of the palm, the tattoo pulses 
rhythmically and emits a faint humming sound when placed directly against the 
ear. 

 You realize you can #6BLAST <TARGET>#0 with this.

viewport xdistance11 xalpha GLASS~
a heavily-reinforced nanocomposite viewport into space~
A heavily-reinforced nanocomposite viewport provides a view of space.~
   Black nothingness monopolizes the majority of the vacuum that 
is visible through the nanocomposite viewport. An arrangement of 
red stars filled with bright yellow stars lies in the upper 
hemisphere of the view, almost like a malformed mouth with gold 
teeth. Several white and blue stars compete for attention in the 
background, thinning near the lower hemisphere where a prominent 
deep, navy blue sphere dominates your attention. Although only 
slightly larger than the largest star, it is clearly a much more 
profound blue than the other specks of cerulean light in the sky. 
The edge of a bold, yellow star that is significantly closer than 
any other helium-fueled orb in view is now visible, its brilliant 
yellow seeming muted, evidently dimmed by the viewport's 
transparent and functional polymer. Visible as a massive globe 
near the corner of the viewport, obviously being targeted 
directly by the bow of the ship, is a somewhat darkened auburn 
and orange globe. The top portion, a slightly off-shade of 
white, darkens in a carefully regimented system of rings that 
colour-code the planet from top to bottom. Near the base, the 
colour is a deep, reddish-auburn; almost orange. Only just 
reflecting the light of the nearby star, you notice a system of 
very thick bands surrounding the orb.

A slender syringe filled with clear liquid has been discarded here.~
   The glass length of this syringe is protected by ribbed 
metallic architecture that gives only the faintest glances at the 
clear liquid floating within. A slender needle with a tiny hook 
at the tip exhibits a distinctive glistening, clearly some kind 
of scratch-proof metal. The fingerhold at the end of the plunger 
is an ergonomically-shaped foam rest for the thumb and index 
finger. A tiny crystal display along the side of the ribbed 
architecture of the syringe displays a tiny circle with 
clusterings of symbols and letters, too complex to understand 
from a distance.

that can easily be compressed down into a disc shape. Its 
surface, covered in a reflective black epoxy, reveals a striated 
arrangement of darker ebony lines that stretch from the

the coil is made of absorbs heat readily and has the inscription, 
"HPR-948-NMN" etched into the surface, circling around the centre

A heavily-reinforced nanocomposite viewport provides a view of space.~
   The vast expanse of black space is speckled with groupings of 
stars, with no particular theme or pattern in their positioning 
or colouring. Blue stars cluster near fatter crimson orbs, like 
a faint trail that scatter behind the largest, yellow orb that 
has grown to such a size that it now hurts to stare at it 
directly for too long. Like some kind of twinkling moss spread 
about the bottom of the viewport, a row of yellow stars, 
interrupted by white and blue dots, twinkle distantly. A small 
red orb dangles in your view, about an eight of the size of the 
large yellow orb, its darkened red shape a deeper crimson than 
the reddest stars you can see.

A $botshape toy of springs and plates lays here.~
   Tiny springs and metal plates come together to form a toy with 
a shape that $botshape. The body springs move easily, giving the 
entire toy a range of motion, in which all the limbs swivel and 
move with enough applied force. A small metal plate dangles from 
the mouth and can be pressed shut and clicked into place between 
the jaw. When left open, it flaps around, with a tiny 'click 
click click.' Great care has gone into the creation of the 
rudimentary toy, with every would-be sharp corner folded over and 
left smooth.

noticeable, however - light-years away, burning solidly through

the light of the star flickering brightly against its atmosphere.

A fanblade electrical switch is mounted beside the blastdoor.~
   Upon closer examination a great deal of rewiring work has been 
done to the blastdoor's locking mechanism. The work is neat and 
economic, all loose ends tied off with electrical tape to prevent 
shorts and electrical arcing. The locking mechanism is nothing 
more than a fanblade, sawed and manufactured into a paddle 
switch. Closing the flip-switch gives power to the panel and 
allows use of the door. While the set up itself is rudimentary, 
it does the job.

Speckles of reflected light, like flecks of glitter, sparkle all 
around the planet as millions of bits of metallic space debris 
spin in orbit. A single grey moon of half-lit stone is prominent 
at the left-edge of the viewport, rotating slowly closer as it 
circles the nearby planet.

Sitting here is a frosty, faintly glowing orb in a plastic shell.~
   This sturdy plastic sphere is capable of being palmed by 
someone with a very large hand, but most would need two to hold 
it. On closer look, there are wires and circuitry woven through 
the outer shell, and there appears to be either a thick gas or 
some sort of ephemeral liquid inside. It is cold to the touch, 
and does not have any clear way of opening, made of interlocking 
bands of translucent blue plastic. At the center, held in with 
supports attached to the shell, is a second orb: this one appears 
to be frosted over, a mass of circuitry, tissue, and some sort of 
seemingly organic fluid. It is frozen, but emits a faint, pale 
light.

#3A tortuous bastion of enmeshed cocoons and desecrated corpses#0~
#3This room is congested with a monstrous bastion of slime-enmeshed cocoons and desecrated corpses, twitching disjointedly.#0~
   The obscene number of translucent, slime green cocoons that have infested 
the majority of the area is sickening, the malodorous stench of rot and 
putrefied decay. The huge oval-shaped eggs are heaped one on top of the other 
with some webbed with sticky strings to the ceiling, inhuman creatures twitch 
and shudder within. An oozing liquid clings and grabs onto boots and objects, 
coating the convoluted bastion in a protective layer.

   #1Dark splatters of blood and gore#0 stain a stool and a significant portion 
of the bar. Small drips of the bodily fluid cling to the edge, pooling upon 
the floor with small chunks of bone and flesh inbetween. It appears to already 
have begun to dry, hasty wipe marks smearing it over the faux-wood.

a rickety, steel access ladder~
A rickety, steel access ladder has been bolted to the wall.~
   This rickety access ladder has been bolted to the wall here, allowing access 
up and down the elevator shaft. While at one time it was undoubtedly sturdy, 
it has long since fallen into serious disrepair - several steps are missing, 
others seem much too short to allow for solid footing, and several bolts appear 
to be screwed loose. All in all, not a good place to linger. 

You can use this to #6CLIMB UP#0 or #6CLIMB DOWN#0.

#3A small, dark hole is tunneled deep inside the ground near a wall, littered with scavenged remains.~
   Tunneled beneath the ground, this small, dark hole looks to have been 
created of bloodied scraps of cloth. Small footprints and tiny claws seem to 
have left their mark upon the sides. Half-eaten remains of small carcasses and 
a few gnawed upon body parts of human origins all seem to be contained in the 
sickly, greenish sludge that seems to pervade the opening of the nest. It's 
impossible to see exactly how far the tunnel descends, but the size appears 
relatively small.

   A plate of thick plexiglass sits on top of stylized, curved chrion bars, the 
bar itself shaped into a C-shape in the center of the room, with a space only 
for employees to maneuver inside of. The edges are all rounded and dulled, 
leaving a slightly safer, but still hardened surface if someone were to fall 
into it. Numerous stools, manufactured in the same style encircle the 
furnishing. Stains and a thick layer of grime have been unkind to the surface, 
marring the otherwise smooth composite with a gritty look that clouds the 
clarity.

the foam-batting beneath. The surface of the table itself has been blemished 
by the stains of time and frequent use, leaving a dull, gritty feeling to the 
touch. It could likely sit about six people, depending on their size.
