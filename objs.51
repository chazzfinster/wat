throne icy remains body parts OTHER~
a throne of frozen remains~
An icy throne dominates the center of the cavern, composed of frozen body parts.~
   This is not so much a throne as it is just a big pile - a 
nest, even, of body parts. Limbs and organs and occasional 
nearly-whole bodies are stacked five feet high and twenty feet 
around, with a deep depression in the center of the macabre pile. 
The bodies are all frozen solid, blood and all - here and there a 
hand reaches out, as if trying to claw away from the pile of 
death, frozen in action. Some parts have been shattered 
completely, and are little more than red shards, glittering 
whenever light may hit them.

some curving cream-colored benches~
Cream-colored benches curve around the perimeter of the room.~
   Securely fastened to the walls, these cream-colored benches follow the same 
utilitarian design as the rest of the ship. Although a few cracks and scuffs 
bare witness to their age, the corners remain softened and the seats themselves 
sturdy. Without cushions of any kind, the stark furnishings offer little room 
for comfort in the way of strict functionality.
