kelp cluster ORGANIC~
a cluster of kelp~
A cluster of kelp grows in a spot of moist muck.~
   Wide, fibrous, dark green leaves cluster together here, 
eminating from a central wad of plant. The leaves are long, 
flat, and moist-looking, blending in with the surrounding sludge. 
The central plant is rooted in a spot of moist muck, clear oozing 
gel thick enough to see in its central cavity before is undulates 
to spread it up its leaves.

   Dispersed and spread out over the area in their every phase roles, these 
people are the normal riff-raff populating the city of Grungetown: men, women, 
workers, children milling along. Hacking coughs, complaints of nausea and all 
around malaise seems to effect the lot of them to differing degrees, their 
constant movement and them being only a bit of the general population makes it 
difficult to maintain them simply for quarantine.
