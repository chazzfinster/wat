#3a churning pile of rotting wildlife#0~
#3A pile of wildlife is here, dead, rotting, stinking, and twitching.~
   The first thing one would notice about this heap of dead animals is that, 
namely, it is not dead. Bits of barkers and spiders twitch about here and 
there, and the entire rotting pile seems to move in sync with itself - 
throbbing, almost as if it is breathing. Every now and then a static pop can 
be heard.

worm-nest hollow larvae OTHER~
a hollow worm-nest~
A hollow worm-nest roils with larvae, its top caved in.~
   Hidden beneath the surface of the sand is a slimy, bulbous egg sac, once 
left in the wake of a crawling worm and now buried in the sun-warmed sands. It 
has a thick, gooey membrane and numerous tiny worm larvae roil within, awaiting 
their opportunity to burst out and begin their lives. This sac appears to have 
been ruptured by careless prospecting, releasing its captives unfortuitiously.

#5A large contingent of heavily armed guards patrols the area in front of the gate.#0~
   Standing before the northern gates is a large contingent of heavily armored 
guards, bearing advanced weaponry. For those keenly observant, a white 
embroidered GC is present upon their armors. Taking up an aggressive poise, 
they patrol with pure professionalism. Overhead, the occasional hovercopter 
shadows the area, a reminder of the backup nearby.
