holopad vaguely glowing apparatus pair of discs OTHER~
a vaguely glowing apparatus of two discs~
Situated into the floor and ceiling is a vaguely glowing apparatus made of two discs.~
   On first glance, these are just two disc shapes set into the 
ceiling and floor, perfectly lined up with each other. Past a 
thick, transparent plastic can be seen intricate, complicated 
circuitry and other machinery, as well as a number of mirrors and 
lenses. It gives off a faint, bluish glow to the naked eye. 
Each disc shape is around ten feet in diameter, easy enough for 
several people to stand on if they desire. Both are slightly 
raised from the surrounding surfaces. Set into the wall on one 
side is a complex entry pad, with a number of keys and a monitor 
display.

The remains of a defense robot have been scattered here.~
   What was once sleek and elegant has been ruined by some manner of weaponry, 
a beautiful piece of mechanical engineering deconstructed into composite parts. 
Just about every bit of sensitive electronics has been utterly obliterated 
beyond recognition, and the fine silksteel soliplast that composed a fair 
portion of it has been warped and marred almost beyond recognition.

A large furnace sits here, visibly damaged.~
   This large piece of machinery has clearly sustained some damage. While most 
are dents or simple wear and tear that could be ignored, a caved in section 
leaves the apparatus unable to properly heat within the shell. Someone able to 
work with armors would likely know how to properly meld the surface back into 
place. The burners, oil filters and exhaust vent appears to be intact and 
functional.

A circular, metal-plated table is here, intact but unstable and removed from its floor sockets.~
   This circular table has been fitted with metal plates, lending it a robust 
and sterile look. Though clearly designed to be bolted to the floor, it 
currently isn't, causing it to wobble unsteadily. The straight, squared legs 
end in escutcheon covers and flanges with holes for bolts to attach it to the 
floor anchors, and being designed for this, it lacks stability when not secured 
to these.

a spartan, metal desk with a detached top board~
A spartan, metal desk with drawers is here, its desktop detached.~
   This metal desk is spartan in construction, made purely to function with 
little consideration given at all to its aesthetic appeal. It is uniformly 
metal: metal desktop, metal sides, metal handles for its metal drawers and is 
undecorated, with rounded corners, but stiff angularities. Two drawers are set 
in either side of the desk, leaving an open space between them where a chair 
might be pushed in. This desk is bolted to the floor, but the screws holding 
the top of the desk in place have snapped from metal fatigue and the entire 
board sits loose and unusable, tipping through the desk's frame with any 
pressure.

a medical cot with faulty utilities~
Bolted to the floor is a medical cot in considerable disarray.~
   Bolted securely to the floor, this simple metal cot has a thin mattress with 
a dusty faux-leather cover. Concealed beneath it is a slide-out tray, likely 
intended for the storage of non-critical medical supplies, such as saline 
syringes, extra needles and a few unsterile bandages. The current state of it 
is a mess: grime covered with dirty needles, tangled, bloody bandages which 
also litter the padding itself, and unidentified chemical stains, making it 
currently unusable. Someone with the knowledge of first-aid would likely be 
able to make a proper inventory of what is required during triage to make it 
functional.

   This resembles a massive metal shower-head that spans about five feet in 
length and two feet in width. Upon further inspection, there is a feed to melt 
polymers and weave polymesh into kevlar fabric, while the shower-head outputs 
the finished product. A complicated control panel is built into the side to 
control it. On the shower-head, the nozzle array and retaining collar are 
broken, the former clogged with rust while the latter has snapped out of its 
socket when the screws broke from metal fatigue.

humming climate control machinery while the rest is cooled storage. A thick, 
transparent door is on the front of the case, allowing visibility of the myriad 
vials and tubes within. Extended disuse has caused the humidity and particles 
of the contents to fuse the door shut, leaving it effectively locked.

precisely fit bullets without discharging the volatile propellant appears to be 
broken and crushed. It would require a set of tools and the knowledge of

Padded cushions are a faded, golden-tone, ripped up in a few places to reveal

a broken beam in the very center of the seat causing no support makes this 
unusable.

a long self-contained growing tray~
A long self-contained growing tray rests here, bare and awaiting planting.~
   About the size of a banquet table, this free-standing tray has a depth of 
three feet, a neutral growing medium having been thickly layered within. The 
medium has the consistency of a thick gel and retains a faint pale peach hue. 
Tubes visibly snake into the tray from a complex set of pipes hooked beneath 
the table and constantly mist the highly absorbent surface of the medium, 
keeping it moist and surface-fluid. A height-adjustable array of grow lights 
hooks up and over the table, born on a firmly crafted metallic arm, a plug 
dangling behind the contraption. Sprouting from a thick metallic arm along the 
left side of the growing station is a small computerized console. The console, 
complete with readout, offers up-to-date information on the workings of the 
machine, as well as the status of those items being grown within. A small 
funnel-topped tube emerges from the right edge of the tray, the other side 
delving within the medium in a spiderweb of delicate connected tubing 
stretching the entire length.

the ankles. The overall color of the garment appears mostly gray although a 
natural iridescence shifts the hue in range from dull blue to faint nude 
depending on how the light catches. In faint silver, a discrete Moon 
criss-crossed with intersecting ovals has been patterned on the chest of this 
garment, roughly over where the wearer's heart. No enclosures are apparent on 
inspection and when pulled, the substance gives to such pressure, thusly making 
it possible for someone to slip it free and down over the body for removal.

   This crude apparatus is roughly five feet in length, and a foot in width. 
It is roughly cylindrical shaped, with a bulbous feed cut into the side. In 
rough white letters on the side reads: #6PLASMA CUTTER - XKI-234#0. It looks 
like canisters can be slotted into the feed, and currently a crimson-colored, 
thick liquid is housed within the crude metal chassis. Indeed, the large 
machine looks to have been forged of copious amounts of scrap metal, and spotty 
impurities are visible. Supported by a tripod, this apparatus' business end - 
much like a cannon - can be aimed in a particular direction. A focusing prism 
has been attached to the business end, indicating that the plasma output can be 
focused into a high-powered thin beam to decimate metal surfaces. A small 
control panel has been installed onto the front to control the machine. 


   You realize you can #6FEED#0 an activated plasma #6CANISTER#0 into the 
apparatus to activate it.

#1A #3yellow-green cloud#1 spreads here with sinister laziness.#0~
   The state of this cloud when one inhales it is that of a choking, sticky 
mess. It seems to stick to the sides of the windpipe, tightening the throat 
and gumming up mucus membranes in the eyes and nose. When close to the floor, 
it swirls according to its own pattern, sometimes seeming thicker or thin 
enough to be blown away by an errant breath or swish of a foot. It is readily 
visible, showing up a sickly yellow-green like a half-digested meal.

blades forged of $ironalloy are welded into place to the pole along with a 
medium sized motor comprised of various gears, circuitry and alternator. Upon 
the tower, a small motion sensor is attached, used to sense the direction of 
the wind, the motor working to keep the blades in its direction.
