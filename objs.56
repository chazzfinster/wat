lodge chaotic concrete xNarcoShop METAL xPCShop xPCDwelling~
a chaotic concrete lodge~
A chaotic concrete lodge, bearing a caduceus sign,  hunkers here.~
   Built like a lozenge out of concrete, this long lodge sports a 
pair of tin-pipe chimneys poking up from either end, which 
usually belch fragrant smoke into the air in pungent puffs. 
Bearing a puffy layer of some sort of plasticrete compound, 
smoothed over its surface like plaster, the lodge has been 
painted a beige gone dingy with elements and time, cracked a few 
places to display the grey-white compound of its construction 
beneath it. Despite the wear, fresher designs have been painted 
chaotically across its surface in mottled but viviid shades, some 
seemingly daubed on directly, leaving finger and hand prints. 
Vegetation and plant shapes are predominant, though the largest 
painting is a sinuously curved serpent in a somewhat ancient 
style, bearing a crest of feathers and wings. Bits of junk and 
bright pieces of reflective plastic and glass have been glued 
here and there onto it, picking out the details. Other animal 
shapes include crude deer, vultures and a crouching image of a 
yellow jaguar. Above a paint-daubed door has been affixed a 
plastic sign, lettering abandoned in favor of a drawing depicting 
a caduceus: a staff wound with two winged serpents, along with a 
fainter etching of a needle and thread that sits at the edge of 
the signage like a scratched-on afterthought.

A series of ridged, black pylons stand upright in a circle.~
   The surface of these five pylons, each as doubly tall and wide 
as a man, are smooth and glossy, but ridged at regular intervals. 
They stand like the black fingers of a giant, shooting upright in 
the ground. Arranged to create a circle on an equally smooth 
thick black platform, these pylons look designed to amplify 
something - or someone. Besides the almost alien-like nature of 
this formation, the hardware appears incredibly complex; hundreds 
of wires snake out from the bottom of this strange formation, 
where no casing protects them, and connects into the platform 
that supports the pylons. iridescent lights flash at the top of 
each pylon, all bending inward to one focal point in the center. 
And any semblance of control over this device seems out of reach 
even to the most trained hand, for small white control panels 
with LED screens and flashing text are mounted on each of them, 
the text scrolling so fast as to be indistinct.

rooms that consist of a small studio separated from a smaller 
bedroom by a ragged curtain.

A roulette table spins here, a crowd gathered around it.~
   A broad table stands here, a black and red numbered wheel 
spinning giddily above it. A barker keeps the wheel spinning, 
loudly calling out wins each time it stops. A crowd of 
individuals stands around it, tossing chips onto the table's 
numbered squares. 

You can play roulette by typing #6BET ROULETTE <bet amount>#0 and 
then your bet specifications. You may type RED to bet on the RED 
half of the numbers or BLACK to bet on the black half of the 
numbers. Or, you may specify between one and six numbers to bet 
on. Bets are accepted on numbers between 1 and 36.

of 10 chips.

A scratched, jagged titon shard lies here, reflecting light.~
   This shard, although clearly composed of an iron alloy, is 
strange to the touch. No doubt its origin was charged with some 
sort of power which you can't, in all your puny non-robotic form, 
fathom. The shard is jagged and almost sharp enough to cut skin. 
It is also scratched and battered from use. It seems to reflect 
light rather well, too.

a sleek, $camocolor hovercopter~
A sleek, $camocolor hovercopter takes up space, settled on its landing gear.~
   Large enough to be a personnel carrier, this $camocolor 
chopper is still on the smaller end of aircraft. It has a sleek 
frame with an obvious cockpit, covered by reinforced glass at the 
bullet-shaped front. With room for a number of humans, the belly 
bulges out, still held aloft by the rodlike landing gear. From 
there it tapers back into two tail wings, each with a 
perpendicular pair of flaps on the end. At each side is a large 
wing, at least half of the full length of the chopper. For more 
than just balance, these expand and encircle two huge rotors. At 
the bases of the wings, along the top, can be noted twin engines. 
Along the tail has been painted "GC" in large, white-bordered 
black letters.

Strewn in pieces in a small impact crater is a crashed, matte black hovercopter.~
   Dust has been heaved up and away from the impact of this 
$camocolor vehicle, which is identifiable as a craft used to 
ferry personnel. The nose is almost out of view, but cracked and 
shattered cockpit glass is visible. One of the wings, and the 
massive rotor contained within, can be found about thirty feet 
away from the main crash. The other one is snapped nearly in 
half, hanging by threads of internal structure, and the landing 
gear is bent and twisted. An area around the twin engines on 
top, at the wing bases, is ravaged by fire and heavily blackened. 
On the side can be made out the partially destroyed block letters 
"GC". They are black, bordered in bright white.

   Row upon row of hatches run down both sides of this hallway, and were one to 
try one of the solid polyprop hatches upon, they would find a roughly human 
shaped capsule - not unlike a coffin. Suitable to hold just one person and a 
few meagre belongings, they are the accommodation of choice for the poorest 
Grungetown residents unaffiliated with a family. 

To rent a capsule, see #6HELP RENT#0.

A makeshift tent of heavy canvas looks to have been recently set up here, amid the numerous other hovels.~
   Erected to one side of the roadway, this large makeshift tent consists of 
heavy sheets of stretched canvas over erected chrion poles to create a scant 
barrier to the elements. Dirt and grime from the marketplace has already 
soiled the sides of it, a splattering of dark brown liquid staining the sides. 
A small group of refugees appear to have camped out here, around six or seven 
at any given time loitering about. You could #6ENTER#0 the #6TENT#0.

   Men, women, and children lay lifelessly under rubble, strewn around the 
circumference of the crater. While most are whole, a few of them have been 
broken and ripped apart by the blast and flying shards of metal. The ground is 
stained and splashed with blood. The heady smell of blood hangs in the air.

wing crater blacked ship crashed spaceship OTHER~
a crashed ship wing settled in the center of a blackened crater~
A crater stretches here, at the very center a wing of a spaceship rests partially crumpled within the downward dip.~
   Though only a small portion of the ship, the wing resting against the 
scarred market backdrop rises in ominous monolith against the bleak sky. It 
has been crafted from thousands of fused ceramic discs over ultra-light 
tungsten-infused metal. The design appears advanced, shape allowing for flight 
through air as well as through space. Much of the structure, despite the 
superior design, is crumpled and damaged due to impact. Painted in sleek and 
subtle black block letters along the edge of the rising wing are the words 
'Liberty One'. In periphery, the market ground is blackened and sloping inward 
towards the impact, creating a large crater.
