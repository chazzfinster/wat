a Dispens-A-Med~
A Dispens-A-Med is bolted to the wall, here.~
   This large hunk of steel is bolted to the wall, blockish and 
unsightly. The steel is painted an alarming blue, way out of 
place with the uniform grey of the steel around it. Scrawled 
across the bright blue paint in yellow letters are the words, 
"DISPENS-O-MED!tm" The right-hand side of the machine offers a 
slot for tokens, as well as several buttons below pictures of 
medicine and medical items.

A broken Dispens-A-Med is bolted to the wall.~
   A hunk of steel is bolted to the wall, in what clearly used to 
be a Dispens-A-Med. The steel is painted an alarming blue, 
seeming way out of place with the uniform grey of the steel 
around it. Scrawled across the bright blue paint in yellow 
letters are the words, "DISPENS-O-MED!tm" The right-hand side of 
the machine offers a slot for tokens, as well as several buttons 
below pictures of medicine and medical items. The machine is, 
however, in a state of disrepair, and would require some 
fixing-up before it could run.

a Food-O-Matic vending machine~
A Food-O-Matic vending machine stands here, humming cheerfully.~
   This machine is made out of plated steel. Several dents lie 
in its surface, possibly attempts to break in, but the machine 
still holds solid. It is painted gaudily -- an orange background 
with yellow sunbursts, "FOOD-O-MATIC!" displayed clearily in 
large, bright blue paint. Buttons are lined up along the 
machine, with a picture of a different food beside them. A steel 
shutter is attached to hydraulic hinges, giving it the ability to 
swing open once a button is pressed.

a blocky security camera~
A blocky security camera is affixed to the wall, here.~
   This camera is little more than a block of metal with a lens 
attached to it - made up of all jagged corners and sharp angles. 
The simple-looking contraption is affixed to the wall via two 
fairly flimsy metal rods that presumably hold the wires that 
attach the camera to the monitor, wherever it may be. 

You realize that you could perhaps #6DETACH#0 this #6CAMERA#0.

completely removed - in fact, forcibly ripped off. The wires are 
a jumbled mess inside, an several are snapped.

the broken remains of a sleek, arachnoid surveillance robot~
The broken remains of a sleek, arachnoid surveillance robot are scattered here.~
   Too say that this robot spider was completely demolished would 
be an overstatement - but not much of one. Its steel exoskeleton 
has been beaten and dented, the paint scratched and peeling. Of 
its eight fragile legs, a majority of them have been bent 
entirely out of shape if not snapped off entirely. Battered and 
broken, this robot is far from functional, but not unrepairable.

however, and it is immediately obvious that this is not made for

waterproof covers and thick acid-free pages, but even so, they 
threaten to crumble when touched, some pages already separated 
from the long-dissolved glue in the bindings, such as 
"Fundamental Trinary Computing." Others are printed on 
plastic-leaf and bound with metal rings and have stood the test 
of time more resiliently, such as a manual on "Starship

and a single red light shows whether it has power or not. A

A massive cylindrical metal pillar fills the center of the chamber.~
   Filling the center of the chamber, this massive cylinder rises 
from floor to ceiling, a constant hum coming from within. It is 
clear that additional mechanics rumble both above the ceiling and 
below the floor. Complex data flows across numerous monitors for 
technicians to review and electronic panels are built into the 
pillar's sides. A clearly marked hatch opens on a rectangle on 
the pillar's side, indicating where additional neodymium fuel 
should be placed.

needs. As the burner and the rest of the apparatus is made of 
metal, along with the insecure power inputs, moving this device 
after pulling it free from its case would be a very bad idea. 
The workings are protected from the burner by thick plastic. The 
stove has a small port where a tube of fuel can be attached to 
allow it to burn for about four hours. The machine, it might be

A $plasticcolor-shafted pole light stands upright here.~
   This $plasticcolor pole about a man's height is topped with a 
translucent sphere containing light-emitting diodes. It is 
manufactured of $polyprop. The plastic housing atop the pole 
contains the electronic components, the heavy battery pack 
installed in the square foot-housing, side-flanges making the 
pole self-standing, able to remain erect and shining light 
brightly over an entire room. A thin plastic strap allows it to 
be carried across the back or on the shoulder for convenience.

A dead, $color battery cell lies here collecting dust.~
   This is a large cube of solid, molded plastic about eighteen inches on a 
side, and extremely heavy for its size. It is covered in $color enamel and 
labels clearly warning with both pictures and words that under no circumstances 
should this fusion unit be opened, crushed, or recycled. In this particular 
case, the cell is completely spent.

an armored, ecru colored pack bearing a magnon transmitting-dish has been left here.~
   This complicated electronic device is able to be worn like a backpack. It 
is armored with overlapping magnon plates and hardened kevlar with 
strategically placed slits for the release of acquired heat from use. A 
reinforced dull-grey case can be slid in and out of the ecru colored pack. 
When opened, it would reveal a vast and technologically sound accumulation of 
microcomponents, processing chips and a small, rectangular screen to scroll 
basic system information. Several connectable ports would allow it to be 
hooked up to a mainframe as an alternate means of transmission. Soldered to 
the top of the case is a foldable magnon transmitting dish, able to be extended 
with a slightly modifiable rotation. A small black switch allows the user to 
#6power#0 the #6emitter-on#0 or #6power#0 the #6emitter-off#0.

A large, floor-standing chemical reactor is here, unconfigured.~
   An impressive piece of sleek steel-cased equipment, this unit is labeled as 
a chemical reactor for small-scale laboratory use. It has an array of 
connectors within its primary chamber for various flasks, pipets, and titration 
arrays to be configured. Around the primary chamber, heavy shielding can be 
closed to avoid contamination during electromagnetic and spectroanalytical 
processes. The machine hums when powered on, fans and circuits providing a 
powerful processing engine for the complex experiments within. A screen and 
data panel allow interaction between the scientist and their program design. 
Currently, the reactor is unconfigured and it would likely take an experienced 
chemist to establish it back into working order.
