a tall, flickering gaslight~
A tall, flickering gaslight stands here, shedding light.~
   A tall lamppost of wrought steel, this gaslight flickers as it 
burns, natural flame within glass panes at its top. The post is 
bolted to the ground, fed by subterranean piping.

   Stoic and set to their task, these citizens of No-Man's Town 
engage in their ceaseless labors by the light of the gas-lamps, 
both through the night and through the day. Large carts mounted 
on steel wheels and tracks take the shoveled muck and transport 
it along the rails to the northwest, where a large glowing 
foundry can be seen. These men, or women, are unrecognizable 
from each other due to the amount of semi-hardened muck covering 
their skin as they work.
