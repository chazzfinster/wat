back, just beneath the chest area, to show the curve and shoulder blades of the 
upper back. On the front, the bustier manages to cover a woman's breasts 
comfortably, and is shaped in a concave crescent to show some cleavage as well 
as to keep them in place. A thin slot below the breasts, on the middle of the 
abdomen is a slot for a weapon for the woman to defend herself with in an 
emergency.

collar explosive METAL~
an explosive collar~
A sturdy, metal collar has been left here, the single light on its front blinking an ominous red.~
   This collar is made of solid titon and is designed to open and close like a 
gripping hand. The clasp keeping this collar closed seems to be hidden 
underneath the shell covering of the collar, preventing anyone from freeing 
themselves from it without a special mechanism. The collar is weighty - while 
it appears smooth and polished, the single, blinking, red light suggests that 
the life of the one who wears this collar no longer belongs to himself.

large black coarse tent magnon poles TEXTILE~
a large coarse black tent~
Erected here is a large black tent, fashioned of coarse polymesh and magnon poles.~
   Erected with care, this wide-open $color0 $polymesh1 tent stands tall, held 
aloft on several $ironalloy poles in a square framework with an arched 'roof'. 
The design is simple, draped fabric acting as a canvas to keep out the elements 
and offer some vague sense of privacy. A flap has been cut into the canvas on 
each of three sides of this construct and when drawn aside like curtains, the 
resulting holes work as makeshift windows to assist in air circulation. The 
fourth side has been split down the center. Should one wish, they could 
#6ENTER#0 the #6TENT#0 by brushing aside that front flap. All in all, the tent 
appears capable of fitting several people within and has the height to allow 
all but the tallest to enter without stooping.

packed with small, bulbous mushrooms, varying in size from a fingernail to a 
golf ball, all feeding on some soup of mineral nutrients in the bottom of the 
tray.

a small translucent specimen box topped with metal~
A small translucent plastic box rests here, a leather glove inset into one side.~
   This box appears roughly a foot and a half in length and only a foot in 
width and depth. All four sides are thick and clear plexiglass, appearing to 
have been crafted with the same technique as greenhouse windows but doubled to 
provide safety and security. The top and bottom thick plates metal, screwed 
into place in seamless craftsmanship. A thick leather glove has been bolted 
onto the plastic, angled inward to allow a person to reach inside without 
exposing their bared hand to the contents. A two by four inch sliding window 
rests just below the glove, allowing items to be placed within the small space. 
The box is currently occupied, filled with the deformed form of a rapidly 
decomposing infected squick.
