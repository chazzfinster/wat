canon gun plasma ruin ancient xHeadbanger xmetrorelic METAL~
an ancient plasma canon of archaic design~
Resting on its forward tripod, an ancient plasma canon lies untouched.~
   Bulky and heavy by virtue of its size and length, this weapon once worked, 
however countless years of neglect have rendered it little more than an empty 
case. Its metallic casing is pitted with rust and brittle to touch. Leading 
down to its raked tip, glass has been shattered and focusing discs have been 
smashed beyond repair. Large enough for only the stronger of people to carry, 
it is held by the oversized grip at its stock and a crudely welded handle 
midway down its barrel. Its large, ovular bore is cracked all the way up its 
tapered barrel. Along its full five foot length are various racial slur, the 
only legible one being scrawled in red in #1TWO EYES OR IT DIES!#0. Inside the 
rusted casing is little more than empty wiring that rattles loosely when moved. 
The only two parts still working are the hinge of its forward tripod and the 
leather strap running from handle to barrel.

a partially-eaten corpse~
A corpse has been abandoned here, partially-eaten. Its face is frozen in a look of absolute fear.~
   Only the upper torso of this corpse remains, the remains of spine and guts 
masked only by the body's bloody, tattered clothing. There are obvious wounds 
on the body, but it would require better lighting and equipment to conduct a 
proper examination. The face is no longer identifiable, especially with its 
contorted expression.

generator echo invisible environment Peter Plot NONE~
#3an invisible environment echo generator (Peter Plot)~
#3An invisible environment echo generator token is here, for the "Peter Plot".~
This token generates "horror" cues according to certain situations:
  on_enter: (1d20)
    1-5: You hear a scratching sound from behind you.
    6-9: An echo of a strange growling sound reaches you.
    10: Static. It fills your ears until you can hear nothing else.
        It starts without volume - deafness. Then it slowly progresses,
        getting louder, suddenly trailing off just before it threatens
        to split your eardrums. Spots appear in your sight, dancing like
        little lights, forming like holes burning through paper. Then,
        nothing more.
    11-20: (Nothing)
-
    * This generates static in the Doghouse in the same way 68002 does
      on_enter. The static only occurs once every 10 minutes, in the
      event that multiple people and groups move through this marker.
      This marker works for both iterations of the "Doghouse static"
      oprog.
-
  look: (1d15)
    1-5: (Nothing)
    6-9: A shadow seems to have shifted from the corner of your eye.
    10: Your vision blurs and circles for a moment. From the growing haze
        you see nothing, until it thickens and threatens suffocation. Just
        when your eyes blacken, you see a large mouth with fangs dripping
        with blood open towards you. Then you open your eyes and find
        yourself once more.
    11-15: (Nothing)
-
  emote: (1d8)
    1-3: (Nothing)
    4: You hear the faint sound of dripping water from behind you.
    5-8: (Nothing)
-
  search: (1d10)
    1-8: (doitanyway) + [6 sec] "...As far as you can tell."
    9: (doitanyway) + [2 sec] "As you search, a trickle of shadow seems to fidget from the corner of your eye."
    10: (doitanyway) + [2 sec] "Something rubs against your foot. When you turn and look, you see nothing."

   This token is used for the Peter Plot. Its presence prevents echoes from 
occurring. So if multiple people activate the same echo, the echo activates 
only once.

grenade cylindrical $camocolor fragmentation METAL~
a cylindrical, $camocolor fragmentation grenade~
A cylindrical, $camocolor hand grenade rests on the ground here.~
   Designed to fit within the hand of a person, this cylindrical $camocolor 
hand grenade is an anti-personel explosive device which is intended to be 
thrown into the vicinity of an enemy position. Packed around the explosive, 
but beneath the plastic case, are an array of chrion fletchettes designed to 
fragment once the explosive has detonated. The detonation process begins when 
the split-pin on the top of the device has been twisted and pulled away, which 
in turn releases the safety handle, which then permits the striker-mechanism to 
detonate the primer, igniting the five second fuse. You may either #6ARM#0 or 
#6DISARM#0 this #6GRENADE#0.
