a glowing blue set of hexagonal panels~
A set of glowing blue-lit hexagonal panels lines the walls.~
   These panels line the wall in all directions, a dizzying array of them 
visible as far as the eye can see, the individual hexagonal panels making up a 
composite wall where each meets its neighbour, leaving only tiny seams between. 
From the seams emits a pale blue light that pulses, very slowly, brightening 
and then returning to its normal hue. The panels themselves are made of a 
quartzlike substance, and they are completely sheer and quite sturdy.

beak-like protrusion. All along the underside are hooks, some harmlessly 
retracted but others wickedly extended, waiting to tear and rip. Vile smelling 
gelatinous cysts quiver with every move of the creature, when popped releasing 
acidic ooze that causes a tingly burn on contact.

married between appetizing and unappetizing.

   Still attached to the body, but not attached to the head that has since

interior is plated with a metallic-sheened black exoskeleton with large plates, 
while large pustules burst and run down the sides.

greenish tissue can be seen inside, coating over the top around the spine, and 
part of what looks like more insectoid innards. Some areas appear almost 
rotten. Multiple tines jut out from between black plates that cover the 
pustule-ridden flesh, seeming to be a metallic alloy. Electricity arcs between 
them, occasionally hitting the floor or nearby slime with a crackling sound.

ooze down on the floor, which gathers around the creature's body, but doesn't 
seem to hurt it. Matching the rest of the creature, it is covered in pustulent 
boils, scabs, and black chitin. Slime appears to be everywhere, and the 
occasional plume of gas wafts from the severed esophagus, followed by rhythmic 
contractions and vomiting sounds as more acid spills out.

A large, dome-shaped cybernetic helmet lies here.~
   This helmet has various open ports and expensive-looking wires portruding 
from it in several sections. It is dome-shaped and made from some metal alloy, 
possessing built-in microchips and cybernetic functions. A green, lit-up visor 
slides down the front of the helmet, masking any wearer's face.
