a modestly-sized, polished bar~
A modestly-sized, polished composite bar sits to the right of the entrance.~
   This modestly-sized, polished bar sits to the right of the aft 
entrance, a number gold painted, metal stools with brown, patent 
leather cushions planted to one side of it. The bartop has been 
carefully maintained and seems to have few to no scratches, 
scuffs or stains. Though made to resemble wood, this piece of 
furniture is clearly constructed out of some plastic composite.

desk spartan drawers METAL~
a spartan, metal desk with drawers~
A spartan, metal desk with drawers is here, bolted to the floor.~
   This metal desk is spartan in construction, made purely to function with 
little consideration given at all to its aesthetic appeal. It is uniformly 
metal: metal desktop, metal sides, metal handles for its metal drawers and is 
undecorated, with rounded corners, but stiff angularities. Two drawers are set 
in either side of the desk, leaving an open space between them where a chair 
might be pushed in. This desk is bolted to the floor.

a wrecked, splintering composite bar~
A splintered composite bar is here, southern end wrecked.~
   This bar has been constructed out of a composite plastic 
material made to resemble wood; like wood, it appears to be both 
sturdy but brittle, and the southern end of this bar has been 
brutalized in the recent past. It is wrecked, splintering, and 
has been crudely patched by duct tape to little noticeable 
effect; it is uncomfortable and dangerous.

Straps are also attached to each section, fit to be situated over
