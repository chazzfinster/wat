a slumped, mummified corpse~
A mummified corpse is slumped at the desk here, face buried in a broken keyboard.~
   Seated behind the desk, this body has been left as it fell, face down into 
the remains of a smashed computer keyboard. The exposure to environment over 
the years has turned its flesh into a rigid, brown-tinged leather. What was 
one presumably a labcoat now clings to the shoulders of this bony body, the 
tattered remains of the garment turned to a grimy black hue. The flesh about 
the back of the head yields to a gaping exit wound, with the empty interior of 
the skull being able to be seen beyond the broken shards of bone surrounding 
the breach.

three huddled mummified corpses ORGANIC~
three huddled mummified corpses~
Three mummified corpses are huddled together on one of the inset sleeping cubicles, caught in some final moment of peace.~
   The wrinkled skin still clinging to the bones of this man, woman, and child 
is brown and leathery, having long been leeched of moisture and any fat. Their 
skeletal system is clearly visible beneath hanging pewter-hued jumpsuits that 
cover the forms from neck to toe. The woman still bears a few tufts of pale 
brown hair to her skull although looking at that, the cause of death is 
evident. Really, it's evident for all of them. Each of them have the telltale 
damage of single gunshot wound to the head. Though the woman and child both 
have round holes and exit wounds at their temples, through from one side to the 
next, the man's skull lays in shards behind him on the pillow, rusted gun still 
lolling lazily out of his shrivel-lipped mouth. Indeed, the woman and child 
are positioned even to best portray them as restful, a luxury not offered to 
the man. In death, his body is more naturally posed in every way, right down 
to the askew glasses upon the remains of his nose.

a gunmetal blue, translucent holodisc labeled 'TD'~
Glinting dully in the light is a gunmetal blue, translucent holodisc labeled 'TD'.~
   A basic, circular and flat holodisc that would appear to be the type to be 
inserted into a computer, this really has little of note to it. The surface is 
vaguely holographic, with the initials "TD" marked on the top surface and 
seemingly suspended in the plastic. 

You realize that with this holodisc you could #6PLAY ONE#0, #6PLAY TWO#0, or 
#6PLAY THREE#0.
