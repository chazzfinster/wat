#5A local shopkeeper is here, looking around nervously.#8~
   A shopkeeper is here, standing nervously near his stall. He glances up and 
down the street, wringing his hands and muttering about thugs. Though his 
wares are completely uninteresting, he nevertheless seems very worried about 
his enterprise.

#5A gang of idle kids drifts about here.#8~
   Half a dozen kids drift about here in the slums, busying themselves with 
playing and petty arguments. They are unarmed and none seem older than ten, 
probably living in the nearby shanties. All Grunger kids know to do as told by 
those who control the street.

#5Some young thugs loiter here, trying to look tough.#8~
   A handful of teenage thugs loiter here, chatting amongst themselves and 
looking mildly intimidating. Though obviously at home in the slums, they do 
not appear to be part of a larger gang and would probably defer to those in 
control of these streets.

#5A small crowd of needy slum-dwellers occupy the street.#8~
   Some of the people living on this street have come out of their hovels. 
They seem to be asking around for help with this and that, some needing their 
shanties repaired while others have questions about news from other parts of 
Grungetown. It is clear that they are looking for those in control of their 
street.

#5Two slum-dwellers are beating up a third here.#8~
   Two typical slum-dwellers are beating up a third by the side of the street, 
punching and kicking him callously. Though seemingly not intent to kill him, 
they're roughing him up quite handily. They seem a little skittish, however, 
and might disperse if approached by someone who is known around these parts.

#5A prostitute trudges along on her way home from a hook-up.#8~
   Clad in worn-down but still provocative clothing, this obvious prostitute 
seems to be on her way home from a hook-up. She is demure and compliant if 
approached, clearly accustomed to paying a cut of her earnings to whomever 
controls her corner.

the rusted husk of a ruined vehicle~
The rusted husk of a ruined vehicle sits here.~
   This ancient vehicle has evidently been sitting here for decades if not 
centuries. The metal has rusted into uselessness, consisting of little more 
than cakes of crumbling, reddish-brown debris, and nothing else remains of it. 
The interior is filled with trash, and graffiti covers most of the outside.

Shades slum cramped shanties OTHER~
a small slum of cramped, destitute shanties~
A small slum of cramped, mashed-together shanties is in the center of the market, accessible via a few narrow entrances between the hovels.~
   Like a miniature village within the market, the Shades is a slum of 
impossibly cramped and tiny shanties that house the lowliest of Rust. By 
the looks of the hovels, they are scarcely big enough for more than two or 
three people to even enter at the same time, and the living conditions are 
clearly abject. However, it looks peaceful enough, being in the middle of the 
neutral market.
   You could #6ENTER#8 the #6SHADES#8 to access the shanty village.
