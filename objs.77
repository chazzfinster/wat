consoles computer screens monitors light control OTHER~
a series of consoles and monitors~
Set up throughout the room is a series of consoles and monitors filled with displays and gauges as to the lighting and power of the ship.~
   Judging from the displays and gauges flashing across the numerous 
$plasticcolor monitors arrayed about this room, this massive computer display 
is designed to monitor the power and lighting consumption of the entire ship. 
Complicated devices and comprehensive displays abound, but one gets the 
impression non-critical tasks such as rerouting the lighting might just be 
possible, if one were so inclined. The flashing and blinking from the consoles 
bathes the room in hues of $color1, $color2 and $color3.

   #6To use the console, type LIGHT STATUS.#0
