which is to say, while still hand-held, it is bulky enough to 
make prolonged use uncomfortable, though that may be unavoidable 
anyway given this tool's tendency to catch things on fire. It 
consists of a small, but heavy, metal tank with a glossy finish 
and, attached to that, a long nozzle that widens slightly near 
the tip. There is a rudimentary hand-grip and trigger attached 
to the underside of the tank, the former worn and the latter 
heavy.

Firebreather apparatus lizard shaped enormous METAL~
an enormous lizard-shaped apparatus~
An enormous lizard-shaped apparatus sits here, painted with flames.~
   This enormous hunk of machinery appears to contain no moving 
parts - all of its vulnerable pieces are hidden beneath a large 
metal husk, along which has been placed several hatches, allowing 
access to the mechanical innards if the machine happened to break 
down. The metal husk that contains the machine is shaped, very 
crudely, like an enormous spotted lizard; whoever was responsible 
for the shape went so far as to shape four sets of clawed legs, a 
tail, and a head with a wide open mouth, containing a row of 
jagged, scrap-metal teeth. 
   A conveyor belt stretches through the machine. It starts 
several yard away, then enters the "mouth" of the lizard's head 
where scrap would be places; and, if one were to look, they would 
see a vibrant red glow from deep within the machine's belly. On 
the other side of the twenty-foot-long apparatus (out of the 
lizard's anus) stretches another length of belt, also a few yards 
in length, where the reformed scrap exits as useable material.

Firebreather xOrganic topless gigantic lizardesque apparatus METAL~
a topless, gigantic, lizardesque apparatus~
A topless, gigantic, lizardesque apparatus takes up the eastern wall.~
   This massive machine's inner workings are hidden from the 
public by thick sheets of metal, rivetted tightly around the 
blocky structure save for two access hatches that sit on either 
end of the machine to allow repairs. This apparatus is the shape 
of half a dome - the top half of it looks like it was hewn off, 
leaving just a curving circle. It is here that organic material 
gets tossed, up and over the machine to be processed within. A 
grate is forged halfway down into the hole, and this is where the 
Stompers stand, the men charged with stomping the bits of 
material down past the grate and into the machine. As the holes 
in the grate are rather wide, these men are particularly 
large-footed and thick-legged - otherwise they might find 
themselves pulled into the machine, to have a leg turned into 
protein paste. 
   The entire machine has been modified with crude graftings to 
appear more like a lizard. The spigot that produces recycled 
goods has had a crude lizard's head bolted around it, which gives 
the appearance, every now and then, of a giant metal lizard 
vomiting food paste. On the opposite end of the machine is a 
spiked tail, jutting awkwardly into the air.

A large, lizard-shaped apparatus sits here, with rows of cloth-covered spines.~
   This machine has had scraps of metal added on and painted over 
time, and sits like a smug crocodile, its head facing the western 
door, painted teeth grinning at the traffic. Access hatches lead 
into the machine's sides for maintenance purpose, but the 
majority of the inner working are covered up neatly by the outer 
casing. Material is fed into the machine's "mouth," and then 
processed, the action hidden up until the very end. The recycled 
cloth gets hooked and pull out on rapidly-moving spines that 
protrude from the "back," getting woven and threaded before 
ultimately halting in front of a worker, who then takes the 
thread to be woven into a more manageable cloth. 

On the side of its painted teeth, a small etching reads: "Chaz".

Firebreather xPlastic plastic encrusted blackened huge apparatus METAL~
a plastic-encrusted, blackened apparatus~
A huge apparatus sits against the western wall, covered in blackened, burnt plastic.~
   The metal of this massive machine is covered in a thick layer 
of blackened, cracked plastic, which not only hides the inner 
working of the machine, but also the service hatches - every 
piece of observable metal is hidden beneath at least one inch of 
black plastic. A conveyor belt leads scrap plastic into the 
appratus, which is then processed. It is from this process that 
all the burnt plastic comes from - somewhere inside the good 
plastic is divided from the bad, and the bad is disposed of. 
Whatever process that was once used for this has long-since 
stopped, and now the molten plastic just falls out of the side of 
the machine, sizzling. A dedicated team of workers move 
constantly around the machine to scrape this plastic free before 
it manages to burn anyone to death, or set anything on fire. 
Another team shoves plastic into the apparatus, and another hands 
the recycled goods to pedestrians.

A tower capped with a titon-steel dish has been erected here.~
   This tower is made with swiftness of set-up in mind with 
several collapsible manon rods raising to the height of two men 
fitting together to keep it erect. Like an ornament, a 
titon-steel dish sits atop, a narrow rod protruding skyward, and 
easily swivelled in any direction. Wires neatly run the length 
of the thing, leading from the dish to a box at the feet, a 
number of ports and connectors seeming ready to accept any manner 
of device.

   This inconspicious piece of off-white tubing seems to beg one 
to not take a more thorough look, though such is rewarded by the 
discovery of a little $color LED blinking out from beside a 
covered recess, which when opened reveals a series of small, 
unlabeled buttons and switches. On either side of the recess are 
a pair of adhesive pads, allowing the small object to be 
concealed in any number of places. Its only sign of origin is 
the GC emblazoned prominently over the covering, the object's 
only real decoration.

a handful of instrument screws~
A handful of instrument screws lies scattered here.~
   There are enough screws here to fill up an average-sized person's hand. 
Each one is quite tiny, designed to be difficult to see from a distance. An 
experienced musician would recognize that these screws are meant to be used to 
assemble musical instruments, due to the screws inability to hold together any 
material that is particularly thick.
