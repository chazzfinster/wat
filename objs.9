box small $polyprop xmystery PLASTIC~
a small, $polyprop box~
A small, $polyprop box has been left here, closed.~
   This small, rectangular box has been beaten from the ages, dents and 
scratches marring the surface to an almost worthless state. Made of $polyprop, 
rust has eaten away at the clasp with grime sticking the surfaces together. It 
would be possible to #6OPEN#0 the #6BOX#0, but it would mean destroying the 
container itself for the object inside.
