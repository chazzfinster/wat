an ancient statue of a giant carrying the world~
An ancient statue of Atlas carrying the world dominates the hall.~
   This gargantuan man has been molded from heavy bronze, age adding a faint 
patina of green to the huge statue. He has taken a knee beneath the weight of 
his load, arms twisted upward to grasp at the massive globe sitting atop his 
shoulders. Almost ludicrously muscular, the man is almost completely naked, 
wearing only a loin-cloth to preserve his modesty. His bearded visage is 
mournful, cast downward toward a sandled foot, as though he is being ground 
into nonexistance by the literal weight of the world resting across his 
shoulders. Beneath him lies a thick marble platform that appears to be on 
wheels that run along a track present in this hall. On the platform is a 
golden plaque that conveys the word, #3"EVERYTHING"#0. You realize that you 
could #6ROLL#0 this statue along the track, #6NORTH#0 or #6SOUTH#0.

a system of five great wheels~
Set into the eastern wall is a series of five great turn-wheels.~
   Five massive wheels have been inset into the cool stone wall here, all in a 
row, with a few inches of space between each one. Only about a third of their 
length actually emerges. Each of the stone wheels has been engraved with its 
own symbol repeatedly along their thick rims, and all of them look as though 
they could spin freely, deep grooves having been cut in the floor to permit 
their rotation. Above the system of wheels, a phrase is painted into the stone 
wall: #1"Never Forget the Past, Present and Future of Mankind."#0 You realize 
that you could #6TURN#0 the wheels in any order, #6ONE#0 through #6FIVE#0.

A statue of a small, bookish man looms, holding up a massive globe.~
   This statue seems almost ludicrous in its unlikely nature - a small, bookish 
man with wispy, thinning hair stands here, his arms raised as though in 
exultation. Above him, he holds a massive earth globe. As though by his sheer 
strength alone, he suspends it in place. His gaze is fixed straight ahead, as 
though staring out at something visible only in the distance, features keen and 
solemn. Along the base, some words have been carved: #3_______: The Savior#0. 
The intricate design of an opening along the base makes you realize that you 
could #6INSERT <SOMETHING>#0 into the base.

   This statue, made from heavy bronze, depicts a small, bookish man with 
thinning hair. He is seated, legs folded, a thick volume opened across his 
lap. One hand reaches up, clasping his chin, finger captured in the act of 
tapping thoughtfully against his lip. The other is busily frozen midway 
through the act of turning a page. His gaze is fixed downward, on the written 
word. Along the base, some words have been carved: #6_______: The Scientist#0. 
The intricate design of an opening along the base makes you realize that you

stands, legs spread, his head thrown up toward Heaven and depicted in a 
ferocious scowl as muscles and tendons stand out in his scrawny neck. Captured 
between his hands is a small earth globe, and he looks as though he is midway

around the object, elbows splayed out. Along the base, some words have been

a heavy stone sarcophagus~
An elaborately-carved stone sarcophagus is here, atop a stone plinth.~
   This elaborate stone coffin is settled atop a low plinth, the raised floor 
polished and marbled with purple streaks. It rises several feet off the 
ground. Elaborate scenes have been carved into the sides, extraordinarily 
detailed, depicting the story of a person's life - farming, fishing, standing 
before a home, along with a series of rather stylized duels and battles, all 
with the same central figure, and all telling the story of a person's glories. 
Others have been carved at the head and foot of the coffin, depicting capstone 
events in the person's life - a wedding, the birth of a child, and other such 
prideful moments. Atop the massive coffin, its heavy lid has been carved into 
an effigy of the soul residing within.

A massive, cylindrical steel structure dominates this area.~
   This huge cylinder occupies a ludicrous amount of space, rising up nearly 
thirty feet. One panel is visible on its side, stretching a good five feet in 
length and covered in holographic read-outs and gauges. It emits such a 
powerful hum that any visitor would feel it in their chest, the frequency 
pleasantly low and powerful. An odd, eldritch blue glow emanates from the top 
- whatever generates this light is out of sight, unless one were to scale the 
construct itself.

a dusty computer powered up atop a small desk~
A small desk sits in the center of the room, housing a dusty PCU.~
   Atop a wooden desk, an old PCU still manages to run on some alternate form 
of energy. Its black background is contrasted by the dull green indicator that 
it is waiting for something to be typed into its creaky, plastic keyboard. You 
realize that you could #6ENTER#0 a #6<PASSWORD>#0 into it.

a sturdy, rectangular adobe ruin~
Forgotten by time, a rectangular ruin made from clay has been uncovered.~
   This adobe structure looks incredibly well intact, considering it appears to 
have been buried for years beneath the shifting sands. A simple blastdoor in 
the front of the rectangular structure appears to also be in working order, 
meaning that you can simply #6ENTER#0 the #6RUIN#0.

#5A couple of interlocked dancers is here, frozen in graceful motion.~
   These dancers are frozen in motion, yet seem to have all the vigor and youth 
of life. Indeed, upon closer look, they appear to be living except for the 
fact that they are absolutely still, frozen in a lifting embrace. The 
heart-faced, auburn-haired woman is smiling happily, mouth open, eyes looking 
down at their partner in surprise. Her partner, a strapping, 
slick-black-haired man holds her by the bosom with both hands high up in the 
air, legs slightly apart for balance. They are stiff to the touch, but 
otherwise seem too real to be artificial.

   This great boulder lies against the nearby rockwall, shaped oddly. It is 
almost as though the rock had been carved from halfway up, follow the delicate 
curves necessary to give it form and purpose; it looks as though a great bird 
were hatching from an egg, spreading its wings upward towards the sky.

#5An orderly crowd of spectators look on here, watching the dancers.~
   Dressed in fine garb, these spectators are a mix of well-groomed women and 
men. All lined up along the perimeter of the room, they're frozen in place in 
various poses; a few men huddle amongst themselves, leaned over with mouths 
slightly open to whisper; a knot of women look to be laughing and looking on at 
the dancers as though in the midst of the telling of a joke; some elderly 
gentlemen sip from empty wine glasses as they intently look to the center of 
the ballroom floor - at the dancers. They look incredibly lifelike, from the 
pallor of their skin to the shine in their eyes, save for one fact: they are 
absolutely still.

words are still legible, though many have faded with time: #6"Rossolo's Fine

is not blinding when held close to one's face.

In large cursive letters, circling the bottle reads: #6"TYBAULT ROSSOLO'S

keypad touchscreen waterproof OTHER~
a waterproof touchscreen keypad~
A waterproof touchscreen keypad is set into the eastern wall here.~
   This touchscreen keypad is designed from some strange technology. It 
appears to be fully functional, made from a strain of polyprop plastic, with a 
touchscreen keypad that rests below the display screen of the device. The 
device itself is set into the wall, seemlessly, without any logistical source 
of cable or connection. The screen asks the user to input a security password. 
You realize that you could #6TYPE#0 a #6<PASSWORD>#0 into the screen here and 
press the execute button.

an ancient steel hatch~
An ancient steel hatch has been left ajar, opening into a void.#0~
   This old, steel hatch is heavy and thick, but entirely without a locking 
mechanism. There is no writing on the hatch or indication of its purpose, 
merely a rubber-gripped handle that could be used to control swinging it open 
or shut. One could #6OPEN#0 or #6CLOSE#0 this #6HATCH#0 at any time. It is 
currently open; an old, rickety service ladder leads down into the darkness 
below. It is impossible to tell just how deep the underground tunnel goes from 
up here.

a heavy, plastic-alloy plasma cannon~
A heavy, plastic-alloy plasma cannon lies here.~
   This highly complicated device is a large, heavy plastic and metal alloy 
rifle outfitted with solar-charging panels. The technology used to create the 
device is strange, foreign. On the side of the weapon is a label, naming it: 
#6The Centaurian - Prototype#0. You can tell that it would use the #1AIM#0 
skill to fire an area #6BURST <DIRECTION>#0. You can also tell that it would 
use the #1AIM#0 and #1RIFLE#0 skills to fire a precision #6BLAST <TARGET>#0 
most effectively.

#4An opaque, pitch-black sphere floats here, crackling and distorting.#0~
   This man-sized sphere floats in place motionlessly, its confines 
unpenentratable to the naked eye due to its pitch-black opaque surface. It 
appears too black to be real. The dimensions of the sphere occasionally 
distort, like a television screen with inadequate reception. You can try and 
#6BREAK PRISON#0 to free whatever and whoever is unfortunate enough to be 
inside.

an oval, gun-black turret~
An oval, gun-black turret rotates here, decimating all in the vicinity.~
   This large gun turret's housing is oval in shape and its diameter is twice a 
man's average height. It has been set on a flat platform, allowing it to 
quickly rotate. Four black gun barrels protrude outward from its base, the 
diameter of each as big as a man's head. The entire housing is smooth and 
looks to be composed of some dull metal, painted uniformly with a gun black.

two orbiting, enormous squid-like vessels~
#1Two moon-sized squid-like living starships hover high in the sky.#0~
   Hanging in the upper atmosphere are a pair of similarly-sized starships. 
They are enormous, the size of a moon or small planet, perhaps. Even from this 
distance, the most horrifying aspect about their dull brown visage is the 
surprisingly life-like qualities of them; though they stay in place in the sky, 
like an orbiting vessel might, they appear to be large squid-like creatures. 
From this distance, their form is too vague to make out any more subtle 
features that they may have, but the body and many tentacled-arms are there. 
They remain close to each other in the sky, sometimes blocking out much of the 
sun when it is noon-time and it is directly overhead; this creates an eerie 
blue halo around them at those times. By night, they are almost impossible to 
see as more than black shadows waiting above for some prey to cross their path.

It currently looks to be inert, unmoving.

Approximations for hand imprints are set to either side of a dusty keyboard. A

A high-tech, handheld remote mine gun lies here.~
   This boxy, handheld device looks vaguely like the guns of Old Earth and 
Luna, but is significantly different in several ways. The gun has no barrel; 
instead, its nozzle is wider, flater and disc-shaped. The triggering mechanism 
requires simultaneous draw-back of a small safety lever. On the back of the 
gun is a video screen. With this device, you may #6PLANT#0 a remote #6MINE#0 
by holding the trigger. You may also #6VIEW#0 the video #6SCREEN#0 if you 
already have a remote mine planted. Finally, by holding the trigger and 
pulling back the safety lever, you may #6DETONATE#0 a planted remote #6MINE#0.
