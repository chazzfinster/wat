a $pQuality2, $genBlade0 blade with a $pHandle1 grip~
A $pQuality2, $genBlade0 blade with a $pHandle1 grip lies here.~
   oset desc 
   This weapon consists of a piece of scrap metal sharpened to 
cut and stab, the blade $genBlade. Aside from the sharpened 
scrap metal, the only other thing on this weapon is the grip, 
nothing more than $pHandle allowing one to grip and wield this 
$pQuality weapon. Measuring about two and a half feet in length, 
it has been fashioned from $ironAlloy metal.

an unsharpened, $genBlade and $pQuality length of blade~
An unsharpened, $genBlade and $pQuality length of blade lies here.~
oset desc
   This blade, measuring roughly two and a half feet in length, 
is rough and unsharpened, unsuitable to be used as any other than 
a rough club. However, it has been beaten and set in to the 
rough shape of a shape, and once sharpened and a grip added to 
it, is likely to make a sword-like weapon that is $genBlade. 
However, the blade itself is far from an ideal piece of metal, 
this object being noticably $pQuality. It is fashioned from 
$ironAlloy metal.

a sharpened, $genBlade and $pQuality length of blade~
A sharpened, $genBlade and $pQuality length of blade lies here.~
   Measure roughly two and a half feet in length, this blade, 
once it has a proper grip fittied to it, will make an effective 
if crude blade. Thoroughly sharpened, once the grip is added 
this blade is likely to make a sword-like weapon that is 
$genBlade. However, despite this, the quality of the metal and 
the balance of the piece is decidedly $pQuality. It is fashioned 
from $ironAlloy metal.

To use it, type #6WAVE WAND#0 and add numbers after it, separated 
by spaces. The first one should be the Object VNUM in this room 
that you wish to set. You can then add up to five more numbers 
with a space in between, which will set OVAL0-5 in order. 

To see how this works, type #6OPSTAT 99013 1#0.
