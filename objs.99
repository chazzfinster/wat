large black coarse tent magnon poles TEXTILE~
a large coarse black tent~
Erected here is a large black tent, fashioned of coarse polymesh and magnon poles.~
   Erected with care, this wide-open coarse black tent stands tall, held aloft 
on several magnon poles in a square framework with an arched 'roof'. The 
design is simple, draped fabric acting as a canvas to keep out the elements and 
offer some vague sense of privacy. A flap has been cut into the canvas on each 
of three sides of this construct and when drawn aside like curtains, the 
resulting holes work as makeshift windows to assist in air circulation. The 
fourth side has been split down the center. Should one wish, they could 
#6ENTER#0 the #6TENT#0 by brushing aside that front flap. All in all, the tent 
appears capable of fitting several people within and has the height to allow 
all but the tallest to enter without stooping.
