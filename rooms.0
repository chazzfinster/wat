Along the Southern Perimeter~
Huge windows line this section of the warehouse's southern wall, flooding the building with natural light despite the dirt covering much of the glass.  Little smiles, hearts, initials, and the odd dick are traced through the grime up to head height.  Higher up, a few panes are cracked and some missing entirely, though each has been carefully repaired with cardboard squares and peeling, yellowed tape.  Opposite the windows, huge pillars covered in chipped, off-white paint provide structural support to the warehouse and create a sort of pathway leading west along the wall of windows.

Along the Southern Perimeter~
107: Jagged edged sheet metal has been welded over the bottom two thirds of the windows along the exterior wall of the warehouse, leaving a single row of panes above to bring in some light from outside.  A single work of art covers the entirety of the metal, depicting a lush, green path through a red poppy field in bloom, the forced perspective pulling the viewer deeper into the painting. The flowers spill from the work, down the wall and across the floor, petals covering the cement underfoot.  Stacks of half-rotten wooden pallets block off the rest of the warehouse, creating a corridor to the west and east.

A Hallway Leading to a Docking Port~
The exposed brick of the hallway here is in disrepair, the mortar chipped and crumbling, leaving white-grey dust and debris across the floor.  A couple of rusted, small circular vents have been sunk into the exterior wall, opened just enough to allow some air-transfer between the musty warehouse and the outside.  Water stains stretch down from these vents, coloring the brick a darker rusty brown in some places, a sludgy green in others where some sort of fungus has managed to take hold.

Western Gateway~
The perimeter comes to a stop here, with the gateway being the last
defense from the wastes outside. It's makeshift and shoddy, composing
mostly of welded together sheet metal. The gate is flanked by two guard
towers, lightly armored to allow some level of protection for those within.
The gate molds back into the fortified walls of the perimeter, which runs
northwards, and would appear to be noticeably more thick and durable
than the gate.

Northwest Corner of the Perimeter~
The perimeter walls form a corner at this point, marking it as the most
northwestern area of the warehouse. The walls are well fortified, overlapping
sheets of metal have been welded together to keep out the harsh weather
and any hopeful intruders. The occasional holes do marr the face of the walls,
giving a glimpse of the desolate desert wastelands outside the walls.
A gateway is seen just to the south, and the perimeter continues on eastwards,
a small path that leads into the center of the warehouse.

Past Some Broken Shelves~
This narrow walkway is lined by what looks to be old shelving units, the steel framework stretching at least fifteen feet high.   Rust completely covers the structure, and the particle board shelves are rotted out or otherwise missing.  A narrow ladder is connected along a track to one side of the shelves, but this too has decayed, leaving half of the rungs missing.  A crusty, thick swath of dingy red paint is splattered across the cement floor, and old, now dry footprints in red leave a trail through the area.

A Crate-lined Intersection~
Plastic crates are piled up on all sides with barely enough space to pass by, the stacks reaching far above the average person's head.   They range in size, though all much too large to move, and seem to be filled with a mixture of packing peanuts, scraps of plastic sheeting, and cardboard.  Various tags and graffiti mark the crates on either side, a myriad of names and crude drawings, mostly black and all quite faded.  Along the floor, traces of red footprints can be seen, fading away if one were to head north or east.

A Bleacher-filled Auditorium~
What appears to be some sort of auditorium, this section of the warehouse
has been cleared from most of the general shipping crates and industrial shelves that
take up most of the accessible areas. Instead, sheet metal bleachers have
been erected in a square, offering seating for quite a few. In the center of
the square, a small platform has been erected, a foot or so higher than
the surrounding ground. The bleachers would appear to be bolted
down, and the metal has certainly lost its sheen to the every present
rust that's eaten away at much of the warehouse metal.

A Shoddy Greenhouse~
This greenhouse area has been quartered off from the general
warehouse spaces. It's quite a change in scenery, with the lack of large
shipping crates, or tall shelves. Instead, plexiglass covers the area from
any outside elements. The walls and ceiling are clear enough, though
it would seem as though this is close to the center of the warehouse, no
real view being given of the surround wasteland. A good view of the sky 
above is visible, though, giving any growing plantlife access to the harsh
sunlight.
