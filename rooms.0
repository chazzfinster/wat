Briefing For a Descent Into Hell~
This desert is strangely picturesque in its harsh beauty; its white rolling 
dunes appear to be like perfect symmetrical peaks; and the sand is immaculately 
white, dotted with the occasional red-hued rock here. The dunes level out here in brief respite, the sands retreating in a 
curious stretch of hard-packed dirt. The sky is brilliantly blue against the 
white backdrop in the daylight, without any clouds. In the northwest is a 
cylindrical tower that looms large against the horizon, a great monolith 
thrusting upward into the sky. It glints dully, looking long worn from the 
harsh elements and caked with dust.

The Graveyard~
   Weeping willows hang over the tombstones scattered about the foggy 
graveyard, a full moon hanging endlessly in the sky to cast sweeping shadows 
over any daring to look upon the gloomy expanse of land. Toward the back lay 
the older stones, chipped away and faded until they are barely legible after 
years of being battered by the weather. Toward the front, shiny and excessive 
marble stones of those rich and powerful enough to afford them as final gaudy 
monuments of their death. Spider webs coat even the fancy gravesides, only a 
very few of the stones giving evidence of visitors with fresh flowers. There 
are two enterable tombs - one where the door is broken down to the west and one 
that appears to be fairly well taken care of to the south. There is also a 
brand new staircase, leading up and down. A platform leads to the Atonement 
Conference Theatre, you can enter it by typing: #6GO HALL#0.

Kithrater's Place~
   The carpet of this room seems to be something stolen from 
whatever evil gods designed and created the floors of your 
average casino, a sickening reddish pattern of whorls and swirls 
dotted with strange yet regular splotches of blue and yellow. 
Fortunately for any curious viewer, this monstrosity is cleverly 
concealed beneath a montage of everyday household goods: 
blankets, dishes, cats, and the entire July edition of the Sydney 
Morning Herald. Two windows set in the northern wall provide a 
stunning view of a brick wall some four feet away, and to the 
south a rickety old door opens inwards.

Impossibility~
   Never. That's how often you've imagined a place as wondrous 
as this. Whirling vortexes of energy and matter constantly 
materialize and dematerialize before your eyes. Whatever comes 
to mind comes into existence. What initially appears to be chaos 
and anarchy slowly resembles an impossibly-intricate pattern, 
constantly changing, each change prompting another change.

An Old Tomb with a Mummy~
   Despite the outer appearance of this tomb, the inside is much 
less clean. Dust and dirt are piled in the corners, and cobwebs 
line the ceiling. Oddly, in the middle of the large expanse is a 
raised platform, and there is a barely open casket set at the 
top. The casket itself has been pushed so it is askew, and the 
lid is cracked open.

An Old, Musty Tomb~
   Cobwebs cover the walls and ceiling, giving odd angles to all 
of the crevices and corners. Whoever or whatever used to be 
buried in this tomb seems to be gone by now, and so the large, 
concrete expanse lays empty, any sound uttered echoing eerily 
around the walls. No lights are around to guide those within, 
only nubs of unlit candles surrounding the walls, and the 
moonlight streaming in from the outside.

Iaew's Haven~
   In the center of this clearing, where sunlight barely filters 
through the dim gloaming of deep forest on even the brightest of 
day, three enormous boulders stand. Cragged and decaying, 
overgrown in moss and fungi, they are nearly as brown and green 
as the giants who tower over them, hemming them into this 
canopied break in the woods. Although the occasional twig snaps 
in the distance and the leaves rustle with the slightest touch of 
the wind's fingers, there remains a quiet hush that hangs lower 
than the intertwined branches overhead. There may be life 
nearby, but here, all lies still.

Phoenix's Bedroom~
   Phoenix's room is surely a feminine one with various wardrobe 
pieces strewn about the place from on top of dressers to a pair 
of heels sticking out from underneath the bed. Peeking into the 
closet would show that she tries to clean her room like a 
mad-woman but obviously, other things get in the way. The head 
of her queen-sized bed is placed just under the window against 
the far wall, the new mattress made of memory foam from Ikea but 
still firm and not the way she likes it at all but her hubby 
likes firm over soft :(.

The Hallway Between Phoenix Rooms~
   This hallway is soft-carpeted in a medium beige color. There 
is a linen closet stuffed with towels and a light that's almost 
always on because Phoenix is a scaredy-cat of horror movies (but 
watches them often). East is Phoenix's bedroom, west is her 
cluttered office, and south is her noisy living room and kitchen. 
North is a bathroom but don't go in there because there's too 
many girly-products on the bathroom counter.

Phoenix's Office~
   A gigantic corner desk dominates the right corner of the room 
which catches your eye as soon as you enter this office. 
Bookshelves with numerous computer and school books run along the 
top hutch while dozens of CDs and other office supplies have been 
organized onto the various shelves that make up the top half of 
the desk. Two run-down laptops sit side by side on the desktop, 
both broken and surrounded by numerous sheafs of paper outlining 
Phoenix's genealogy. At the opposite corner of the office stands 
a much smaller computer desk with an old, Gateway PC that runs 
better than the newer, already-broken laptops on the big desk. 
Another shelf full of various popular fiction books is pressed up 
against the only empty wall, out of the way beside the closet 
door that, when opened, has way too much stuff inside.

Phoenix's Living Room~
   This room certainly is alive with action from video games 
blasting on the flat-panel widescreen mounted on the wall to the 
sound of the little, Siamese kitten scratching on the cat post 
just beside the couch and the neighbors next door hanging out on 
the patio. Just outside the window you'll see that this 
livingroom is just one of many in the apartment complex and 
typical of a couple of college students: clean but messy in all 
the right places and way too many video game consoles. A plush, 
olive green couch sits opposite the TV with a simple, black 
coffee table set before it, various remotes and a girly tea mug 
cluttering its surface.

A Flickering-Light-Lit Corridor~
   This narrow hexagonal corridor is defined by the six drab, 
grey walls that run from north to south. A flat surface lies 
underfoot and overhead, deep gouges and char marks running the 
length of the floor and a series of flickering, spasmodic strip 
lights decorating the ceilings. The harsh, dirty light that 
emanates from above appears to be almost absorbed by the walls, 
save when the lights cut off randomly for a few seconds before 
spluttering to brightness once more.

Canyons Before A Massive Waterfall~
   The deafening roar of rushing water consumes all other sound 
as it comes crashing down, cutting deep into the Red Rock Canyon. 
At the narrowest, the waterfall spans a couple hundred feet in 
width, with the waterfall itself spilling nearly twice that 
length down. Along the sides of the canyon, a vast number of 
birds have taken nests among the cracks and crevices in the rocky 
canyon walls, squaking out their warnings to anything brave 
enough to come near.

   This spacious cavern, nearly invisible to the naked eye behind

with a mirror-like polished obsidian marble, however, a sloped,
vented, steel runway cuts straight through the middle and out the
opening, the other end reaching far back to the end of the cavern.
Ornately detailed pillars of the same marble stretch from floor to
ceiling, set on both sides of the ramp. 
   A small chamber has been carved into the side of the cavern, 
shielded by a sturdy, electronically opened metal door. South leads
through the waterfall.

Briefing for a Descent into Hell~
   RPI MUDs differ from other MUDs in several key ways. 

In an RPI MUD, you create a character and immerse yourself -as that character- 
in a virtual society and world. Roleplay is absolutely mandatory and strictly 
enforced, and you are expected to remain "in character" at all times while 
logged in. Players are rewarded based on how well they play their character 
and how well developed their character is: what are their hopes, dreams, 
aspirations, fears, and failures? There are no levels and you do not earn 
experience for killing mobs. Character death is permanent, and once dead, your 
character remains so. 

Basic information - general commands, etc., - can be found by typing #6HELP 
NEWBIE#0. To find out about specific elements of the world, the code, and more 
or less anything else about Atonement, the AtonementWiki will help: 
atonementrpi.com/wiki/index.php/Main_Page.

A Massive Armory~
   This room is massive beyond description. The corrugated steel 
roof is about twenty feet above, supported by trusses and steel 
support columns. The racks of weapons go so far north and south 
that the walls cannot be seen. West, a solid door leads into a 
cemetery, and to the east, a wide double-door opens onto a sunlit 
road named Hogan's Alley. Above, a ladder leads to the rooftops 
of the alley for those looking to practice sniping, and a large 
hatch leads down into the sewers below, the cries of beasts 
audible therein. 

You may leave to the #2west#0, use an exit to enter combat space, 
or #2request#0 a #2pistol, rifle, smg, axe#0 or #2traps#0 from 
the Armory here.

   A desolate streets runs along here, the pavement cracking from 
age and use. Off to the south is a two-story school house with 
playground equipment in the yard. Behind it in the distance is 
an imposing factory-looking building, smoke coming from its 
chimneys. Along the north side of the road are several 
buildings, separated by a a side-street visible down the way. 
Immediately at the roadside here a Laundromat, just up a small 
flight of stairs.

Crestwood Laundromat~
   Wide and bright, this Laundromat is a simple square building 
on a concrete pad, with clear glass windows on all sides and a 
glass door leading out onto the street to the south. 
Silvery-steel washers and dryers hum and clunk constantly, 
tumbling the clothes of customers who seem to have fled rapidly, 
leaving their laundry behind. One corner of the room has a 
change machine and some old video games, beeping noises coming 
from Target Terror and Duck Hunt terminals.

An Elementary School Playground~
   A cracked and worn blacktop pad takes up the center of the 
playground, faded white paint marking lines for kickball and 
hopscotch. A set of swings creaks slowly in the breeze, chains 
hanging from the steel bar above, flexible rubber seats roasting 
hot in the sunlight. An old teeter-totter, two of the three 
boards knocked off the beam, stands to the side by a balance 
beam. A faux-wood fort made of molded plastic is installed above 
a bed of wood chips. A bendy slide comes down from it in a wide 
curve and a rope net leads up to the platform within.

Along the north side of the road is a barbershop, with an 
intersection lying down the road to the east past a hotel.

Angelo Martino's Barber Shop~
   Faded and worn decades ago, this barbershop is dusty, but with 
an antique feel. Chairs line the wall for waiting customers, 
ancient copies of Spiderman, Green Lantern, and the Archer 
resting on end tables between them. Posters hang on the wall of 
men's hairstyles from the 1950's, curling at the edges and 
yellowed. A large blue jar full of disinfectant holds black 
plastic combs on the counter, a round dish of talc sitting next 
to it. On a tray by the barber's chair, an array of shiny, 
well-kept scissors rest on a brown towel.

A Baseball Field~
   A rusted chain-link backstop marks the location of home plate, 
a bench behind it on either side for the home and away teams. A 
diamond of tan sand runs evenly out to mark the ballfield's 
shape, unmowed grass standing almost two feet tall and gone to 
seed, puffs occasionally letting loose to blow on the wind. In 
the center is a tall pitcher's mound, tan sand in a sea of grass.

the rooms-for-rent while a circular stairway leads to the upper 
level.

A Ballroom At the Top of a Stair~
   At top of a spiral staircase is a wide, open ballroom. A 
faux-crystal chandelier hangs from the ceiling at its center, 
faded and threadbare oriental carpeting lining the floor all the 
way to the edge of a wide, hardwood dance floor. There is 
virtually no furnishing here, save a bandstand to one side. 
Hallways lead down to the left and right to more rooms-for-rent. 
To the south, glass doors lead out onto a balcony overlooking the 
street.

Inside the Bank~
   Marble flooring and inlaid mahogany woodwork are the hallmarks 
of this room, its tall vaulted ceiling giving an air of space and 
confidence. Windows of plexiglass rest between wooden panels 
along the north side of the room, stamps and adding machines 
ready on the countertops. Red velvet ropes strung between metal 
posts weave back and forth across the center of the room.

   A hard-packed dirt road leads south here from Main Street, 
leading on to more homely looking buildings further on. The 
squat brick shape of the bank looms to the west, a rickety fire 
escape climbing its side like a viny of ivy. To the east is an 
unused field at the edge of town, a slight ridge to the 
northeast.

The Roof of the Bank~
   This is a wide, flat tar-papered roof of a one-story building. 
It looks north to the balcony of the hotel, and has a commanding 
view of the fields to the east, or the road below. It is reached 
by a rickety fire escape climbing the east side of the bank 
building.

A Desolate Field~
   Filled with tall grass and scraggly thistles and dandelions 
blowing in the breeze, this is simply an empty field lying off a 
dirt road to the west. A squat brick building is seen beyond the 
road to the west, while a cemetery can be seen, eerie and dark, 
to the northeast.

A Desolate Road on the West Side of a Small Hill~
   A desolate street, pavement broken and cracked, rises up a 
small hill as it leaves the town of Hogan's Alley to the east. 
The hill crests just to the east, then begins its decline to an 
eerie cemetery just beyond.

Atop a Sharp Ridge~
   This is the top of a grassy knoll. A broken pavement road 
crosses to the south over a more gradual spot of the hillside. A 
dirt road lies down and to the west, too steep an escarpment to 
climb. Just on the other side of the dirt road rises a tall, 
two-story hotel, its top at roughly eye level. Down a gradual 
hillside to the east is an eerie cemetery.

The Roof of the Dogwood Inn~
   This is the flat, tar-papered roof of the Dogwood Inn, the 
only two-story building in Hogan's Alley. It has a commanding 
view over the town, including down on to the bank roof to the 
south across the street. To the east, this vantage looks roughly 
straight across to the top of a steep hillside. A brick ledge 
surrounds the roofline with decorative crenellation, offering 
some cover and protection, particularly to the south and west.

A Hillside Descending Into a Cemetery~
   Hallway down a hillside, the gradual climb from above is now a 
bit more difficult as it drops to the cemetery headstones below. 
A dark and looming crypt, its door broken in half, can be seen to 
the east at the cemetery's center.

into an eerie cemetery westward and below. A single, mostly dead 
Hangman's Oak creaks in the wind, a noose still dangling limp 
from a half-broken branch.

strange holes and rusty blood-stains appearing random.

Among the Cemetery Crypts~
   Loamy grave soil gives uncomfortably underfoot, seeming as if 
it will collapse and tumble passers-by into a six-foot permanent 
bed. A few tall, sinister trees stand amongst standing 
gravestones and monuments, creaking in the wind. Graves here are 
burst open from below, the zombified occupants clearly having 
risen to find another home. To the east is a cracked crypt, 
leading on to a deeper section of cemetery. 

From here, you may type #2ENTER CRYPT#0 to return to the Guest

A Desolate Road Among Cemetery Stones~

faded and grimy artificial flowers. The whole cemetery has an

A Bloody Field South of a Cemetery~
   Simple grassland riddled with thistle and snares, this land is 
trampled heavily, ancient graves forgotten by the gravekeeper 
burst open from below to disgorge their former occupants. Fresh 
blood is splattered over the earth, signs of strife apparent in 
all directions. The fields continue to the west, an eerie 
cemetery just north.

   A narrow alleyway ends here, coming up against the walls of

Through the windows along the south side can be seen the inside 
of a laundromat, machines tumbling.

Inside a Stiflingly Warm Playground Fort~
   Thick molded plastic makes up the walls and roof of this 
playground fort, which is just a bit too short for an adult to 
stand upright in. Nonetheless, it is a respectable distance 
above the ground, with the only egress being by a bendy slide or 
down a rope climbing net. Square windows look out to the north 
and east able to see into the distance. A round Ship's Wheel 
mounted on one wall allows an imaginative youth to pretend he's 
captaining a sailing ship into the horizon, but the wheel is 
connected to nothing but a greased axle and a plastic mechanism 
that makes a clicking noise when it is turned.

this might have been once a glorious altar in its heyday, seaweed 
and algae have crept up the stone and dulled the gold.

vstr You find yourself in a cramped, five-meter by five-meter room, with a low ceiling that an average-sized person could probably reach.  There is no sign of a door, or window, and the lone source of light is a faint, flickering, naked light bulb dangling from wires near one of the room's corners.  The walls are a dark, grimy grey, and the paint is peeling wherever one looks.  A metal cot is set against one wall, and a grate at the room's opposite end carries the distinct odor of stale urine and feces.  At odds with the room's environment is a small, modern-looking metal platform set into the wall opposite the bed, about a hand's length above the floor.  You can #3approach#0 the #3platform#0 to stand on it, or you can #3examine#0 the #3grate#0 in more detail.

vstr You come within a half-dozen steps before the smell threatens to overpower you.  Trust me, you want to leave this alone until the threat of soiling your undergarments is too great to ignore.
~
P
approach~
platform~
vstr You approach the platform and step onto it.  A faint hum begins to echo throughout the room when your weight comes to rest upon the platform's edge.  The air shimmers before you for a few moments before two translucent, ethereal globes material, rather near the wall.  The left-most globe is green in color; perhaps a half-meter to its right floats a red counterpart.  The globes are both fist-sized.  You can #3touch#0 the #3green#0 globe; you can #3touch#0 the #3red#0 globe; you can also #3leave#0 the #3platform#0 without exploring further.
~
P
leave~
platform~
vstr You step off the platform, and the faint humming sound fades into nothingness even as the two globes wink out of view.  The room is again shadowed, with only the faint light afforded by the bulb hanging from the ceiling protecting you from absolute darkness.

A Quiet Changing Room~
   Clothes make the man. Or woman. In this shop, you can freely purchase all 
the clothing your character might need. You will also be introduced to 
Atonement RPI's powerful system of variable items. To get started, type 
"#6list#0" to see what clothing templates are on offer, and then type "#6buy 1 
variable ?#0" to see how you can use variables. 

Once you understand the system, and wish to try out outfitting yourself, take 
"#6cash out#0" to receive some funds. Use the "#6wear#0" and "#6remove#0" 
commands to dress yourself. 

When you're ready to leave, type #6IMMERSE#0 again. Please note that upon 
doing so, all the clothes that you are wearing will be placed in a secure 
location - you'll retrieve them after picking your armour and weapons. You can 
type #6CHECK CLOTHES#0 to see your items of clothing at any time once you have 
passed this room.. 

If you're feeling shy, nervous, or confused, feel free to talk to one of the 
other players here, or visit one of the changing rooms to the north, east, 
south and west. 


   If you would like some quick and easy examples of what an average player 
might purchase, type #6LOOK EXAMPLE#0. Also, if you would like assistance, 
feel free to type #6HELP HELPLINE#0 to read how.

The Armour Room~
   The remnants of the Moonscape is a dangerous place. 

Nearly everyone but the very poorest inhabitants of the Outlands 
dresses in some kind of armour. You're no different. Whether it 
be crude shirts and trousers of padded cloth, home-made tanned 
leather vests with sewn metal strips, or cottage-industry 
produced kevlar-esque armour, if you want to survive, you need 
protection. 

Type one of the following to customise your suit of armour: 

1. #6pick padded#0: a full suit of padded armour, which while 
the weakest armour available, is cheap and easy to repair. 

2. #6pick leather#0: a vest of leather-and-metal, excellent at 
protecting against the wild animals of the Outlands. 

3. #6pick kevlar#0: a vest of a kevlar-like polymesh, excellent 
at protecting against gunshots. 

4. #6pick coat#0: a heavy armoured coat, providing protection 
from weather and threats alike. 

Or, if you would like to go back and pick your clothing again, 
type #6RESET#0 to return to the original room naked as the day 
you were born

Padded Armour Room~
   You've decided to go with a full suit of padded armour. While 
no doubt the least effective of all armours on the Moon, it is 
cheap and easy to repair, hence why you have been able to afford 
a full suit of it, rather than only a couple of pieces of armour 
as would have been the case if you picked one of the other 
options. 

Just as with the clothing shop, use the #6list#0, #6buy 1 
variable ?#0, and #6cash out#0 commands to pick and choose from 
the armours available to you here. Like the clothing shop, you 
will only progress with the items you are wearing - anything you 
are merely holding will be destroyed. However, unlike the 
clothing shop, certain variables are restricted - for instance, 
you can only use chrion metal, uneven polyprop and coarse 
polymesh. 

Once you have bought all the armour you want, type #6IMMERSE#0 to 
continue. You can return to the beginnning at any time by typing 
#6RESET#0, change your choice about armour by typing #6GO BACK#0, 
or check your clothes by typing #6CHECK CLOTHES#0.

Leather-and-Metal Room~
   You've decided to go with a half suit of leather-and-metal. Almost unknown 
outside the Outlands, it is a native-built suit of tanned leather taken from 
wild animals reinforced with metal strips, providing excellent protection 
against the kind of creatures one will face in the environs of Rust, but does 
little to slow bullets. 

Just as with the clothing shop, use the #6list#0, #6buy 1 variable ?#0, and 
#6cash out#0 commands to pick and choose from the armours available to you 
here. Like the clothing shop, you will only progress with the items you are

Kevlar Room~
   You've decided to go with a half suit of kevlar mesh. The 
armour of choice for soldiers and would be soldiers, it is 
fashioned either en-masse in factories or by numerous cottage 
industries spread throughout the Moonscape. Made from a blend of 
polymesh and polyprop, it is significantly superior to modern-day 
kevlar, particularly in its ability to withstand melee attacks. 

Just as with the clothing shop, use the #6list#0, #6buy 1 
variable ?#0, and #6cash out#0 commands to pick and choose from 
the armours available to you here. Like the clothing shop, you

Overcoat Room~
   You've decided to go with a heavy armoured coat. Many more 
prosperous denizens of the Outlands choose this style of armour, 
especially those not engaged full time in combat. Fashioned from 
the same techniques as kevlar armour, a heavy overcoat can 
provide a good degree of incidental danger that a merchant, 
intellectual or other skilled person may find themselves running 
across.

and have nothing left in your hands before continuing, or those 
items will be destroyed. When you are ready to progress, type

   In this series of rooms, you can pick a number of special 
items, designed to help your character either fulfill a 
particular role (such as an gunsmith or doctor), or merely be a 
combatant and pick an otherwise hard to come by firearm. 

You have been given only one ration in this room - the #6cash 
out#0 command will no longer work. This is to restrict you to 
one and only one choice in this room. #9#6Giving your ration to 
another player to allow them to make a second purchase will lead 
to punishment from the administrators#0. 

To the east, firearms are for sale. To the north, specific 
equipment of interest to crafters, doctors, and computerologists.

Merchandise to Keep you Alive~
   This is the final room before you enter the game. It's 
recommended you take a moment to get dressed, and assess the 
options before you. You should have been given 2 black chips - 
if not, type "get chip", as they probably fell to the ground as 
you had your hands full. 

In particular, you may want to explore which #6crafts#0 you have, 
and see what the #6material#0s of those crafts are. Be sure to 
use the #6list#0, #6preview#0, and #6buy#0 commands to pick up 
all your stuff. 

There are a lot of useful things here, and you've only got so 
much money with which to buy them. To receive some more advice 
on what you may or may not want, type #6HINT ESSENTIAL#0, #6HINT 
COMBAT#0, #6HINT CRAFTING#0, and #6HINT USEFUL#0. 

And then there are an assortment of other goods, some necessary 
and some not, that you may want to purchase - or save your cash 
for eventualities later in game. 

Of course, it is not possible to buy everything you need in-game 
with the money you've got: that's just the nature of 
AtonementRPI. You'll need to learn to make do with scarce 
resources. 

All sales are final, and when you're ready to move on and enter 
the game, type #6IMMERSE#0 one last time.

Or, if you're not happy with your armour or clothing, type 
#6RESET#0. This is the last chance you have to change armour or 
clothing without an admin helping you out, so be sure of your 
decision either way! 

If you've gotten a weapon caliber you shouldn't have, i.e. 
anything but .20 for a SMG, .25 for a pistol and .30 for a rifle, 
you will be unable to find bullets for your weapon in the room 
beyond.

   This is the final room before you enter the game. It's 
recommended you take a moment to get dressed, and assess the 
options before you. You should have been given 2 black chips - 
if not, type "get chip", as they probably fell to the ground as 
you had your hands full. 

In particular, you may want to explore which #6crafts#0 you have, 
and see what the #6material#0s of those crafts are. Be sure to 
use the #6list#0, #6preview#0, and #6buy#0 commands to pick up 
all your stuff. 

There are a lot of useful things here, and you've only got so 
much money with which to buy them. To receive some more advice 
on what you may or may not want, type #6HINT ESSENTIAL#0, #6HINT 
COMBAT#0, #6HINT CRAFTING#0, and #6HINT USEFUL#0.

Boo's Castle~
   Dust drifts lazily in the air, offset by a more distant scent of dank, damp 
must. The walls are discolored and damp grey stone, streaked with black and 
unfinished, rough against skin. Along one wall have been fastened securely a 
set of rusted, discolored manacles which match a wrought iron grate overhead. 
From this direction filters some dim light, along with the distant sounds of 
life and laughter. To the north, a steep stairwell leads upwards.

Epitaph's Office~
   This office is both spacious and lavish, with sheets of 
textured, painted polyprop tacked to the walls to imitate the 
appearance of stained mohogany wood. The floor is covered with a 
coarse, thick-threaded dark red carpet, while the ceiling has 
been left a natural, off-white hue. Some shelves containing 
ancient books hang on the wall, and a sleek, glass-topped steel 
desk dominates the center of the room, its modern design looking 
somewhat out of place with the rest of the decor. To the north, 
a curtained window offers a view of Grungetown's slums. Other 
than that, there are no obvious exits.

Lunar Authority Mainframe~
   The constant cacophony of ever-running machinery fills the dusty air, its 
whining and whirring seeming to fluctuate from deafening to merely annoying 
with every passing moment. Flashing diodes litter the wall-sized computers, 
flickering on and off in some incomprehensible language. A vocoder sits front 
and center, the machinery whose purpose is is revealed every few moments by the 
eruption of a likely surprisingly convincing human voice. The room is most 
often empty, beyond the cursory inspection of the occasional tech.

   Stark, electronic blue walls and miniature televisions make up

sits across from the monitors and a singular stand sits cocked 
adjacent, with blue-square cards on top. Also, lots of Troy 
Polamalu gear is plastered all over the podiums. It's quite

A Hidden Attic~
   Here, things are a little more normal, but only relative to 
the madness of the last room. At least the laws of physics are 
adhered to, appearances would have one think. The room itself is 
a large, cramped attic, with hardwood flooring. The wooden walls 
slope up to meet high overhead; if one looked upon them from 
outside, they would look like an upside down 'V'. One side of 
the walls, there is a large section which can retract on the 
pulling of a switch, which sits nearby, just waiting to be 
pulled. 
   All about the room are tables, covered with vials of oddly 
colored liquids and instruments of strange design and meaning. 
Beneath the retractable section of the wall there sits, on top of 
an extendable pillar, an operation table, with leather straps for 
arms and legs.

A Grungetown 2.0 Holding Area~
   This is a quaint little lounge for people to sit and talk, while being held 
for reentering the world of GT 2.0. This is also the start of a briefing room, 
as you will find many things have changed. Please see below for anything about 
your clans: 

   #6GO REDS#0 if you are a Red, to find out what happened.
   #6GO VULTURES#0 if you are a Vulture, to get their tale.
   #6GO WILMINGTONS#0 for Wilmingtons to get debriefed.
   #6GO LODGE#0 if you are a lodgy, to learn what happened.
   #6GO DEATH-HEADS#0 if you are a Death Head, to find out stuff.
   #6GO ANAXIOS#0 for the Anaxios, to get debriefed.

Anyone else, please go northwards and prepare to reenter the game!

What became of the Red Army?~
   The terror of that day burned into your soul the true threat of New Phoenix. 
You remember the screams, cut off by the staccato death of the autocannons. 
You watched your comrades fall in droves. Luckily, you managed to survive, 
pulled back into the Market or into cover. You may have gone undercover, 
trying to blend in in the time being, or you may have been one of the ones to 
keep the shattered army together, trickling together in a burnt out building 
north of the broken HQ. All you do know, is the acid hate that wells up in 
your throat when your think of what New Phoenix has done to your comrades, your 
family...and you know that that, however broken, the Cause will never die. 
Vive.

What became of the Vultures?~
   The Vultures lost the bulk of their footsoldiers in the destruction of 
Grungetown. Many of the strippers and shopkeepers holed up in the Golden Touch 
during the assault, the shack being made of concrete, but the birds are 
severely lacking in brute force after the apocalypse. With all leadership 
above Rooster gone, he rallied the Family on Tameo's orders and last words, 
gathering what survivors he could find to do what they could to reclaim their 
many shops in the market. Knowing that they would be vulnerable with so few 
fighting birds left in the flock, Rooster decided to focus his efforts on 
business and politics instead, as much as can be managed with the current state 
of affairs. He hopes to venture back into their old turf and uncover some of 
the facilities they held before, knowing that the key to their survival and 
regrowth would lie in the possession of some valuable commodity needed by the 
rest of Grungetown's survivors.

What became of the Wilmington Family?~
   The Wilmingtons, of course, spearheaded the efforts of getting relief to the 
multitude of displaced Grungetowners, distributing as much food and water as 
possible. The Wilmington Municipal Center's infirmary, having a rather large 
surplus of medical supplies before the attack, would be giving free treatments 
to as much of Grungetown as possible. Without the presence of the Nangong, the 
Wilmington Guard have taken over policing the Market, putting an end to rioting 
and placing any troublemakers in the new prison inside the Wilmington Compound, 
at least temporarily until people calmed down. Wilmington Technicians were 
ordered to get the organic Firebreather online as quickly as possible, as well 
as told to maintain the Market's electrical and water systems. T majority of 
the Wilmington forces were be ordered out helping people right now in the 
various sectors of the Market Slums.

What became of the Lodge?~
   Rising from the ashes of Grungetown under the leadership of Mina, the Lodge 
was soon inundated with hundreds, almost thousands of wounded citizens that 
needed assistance. Much of those first lunar days were spent finding the many 
bodies of those killed, and to prepare as best you could funeral rites for 
them. The Market swiftly turning into a slum, you and your band realized that 
the only hope for the Lodge was to escape, and so you did, to an abandoned 
factory on Umbra Road, north of Wilmington Way in an area known as Dom's Walk. 
Those able to fight have been working as guards for the helpless, while all 
scrape together supplies for the new facility. You have managed to move much 
from the Lodge into the factory, but it will still be rough going in the future

What became of the Death's Heads?~
   Rising from the ashes of Grungetown under the leadership of Jesse, the 
Death's Heads initially kept to themselves after the staggering violence of the 
attack. You are one of those Death's Heads, and for whatever reason you have 
seen fit to stick with the group and assist with the rebuilding of the Market 
under the Wilmingtons. But you were not mere vassals, as the dead were burnt 
and groups set out into shattered remains of Grungetown's outer turfs, you 
found a long abandoned flashball court along Buzzard Boulevard near the 
northern perimeter. A few poor sods have followed, taking residence in the 
shattered turf, and it will be up to you to win their hearts, and to keep a 
firm grip on your new base of operations. You have named your turf, 
"Westside."

What became of the Anaxios?~
   Rising from the ashes of Grungetown under the leadership of Midas, the 
Anaxios were soon ordered to collect what they could and march from the safety 
of the Market into the lawless outer turfs. You are one of those men or women 
who followed him to one of the lesser roosts north of the Revolutionaries 
stake, taking over an abandoned warehouse along the eastern curve of Main 
Street, or what was left of it. It was there that you, under the leadership of 
Midas, staked your claim as a Templar to both defend your newfound territory 
and protect the few hundred citizens that have managed to scrape by since the 
attack. For the past three lunar days, you and the founding members of the 
Templar Order have been busy at work, both repairing and fortifying the turf's 
buildings, as well as trying to win over the hearts of the terrified people who 
now inhabit the territory they control. You have named your new turf, "New 
Grunge."

Newbie Guide: Mudding Basics~
MUDs (Multiple User Dungeons) are text-based games that translate your
input and convert them into action. Everything that you can do in a MUD
can be performed by inputting the correct command. You can see a list
of commands by typing the word "#6COMMANDS#0". Don't do this now, though.
Just keep it in mind for later. This, combined with "#6HELP#0", will
allow you to know what the commands are used for (eg. "#6HELP NEWBIE#0").

Within the newbie guide, you can "#6QUIT#0" at anytime if you ever need
to leave the game. Quitting the game will be discussed in detail later.

Input "#6NEXT#0" to proceed with the Atonement Newbie Guide!

(You can input "#6DONE#0" at any time to exit this guide.)

Newbie Guide: Roleplay~
Atonement is a Roleplay Intensive (RPI) MUD, and as such, roleplaying is
required at all times. To roleplay is fundamentally to realistically act
out your in-game character using his own motivations, with total disregard
of OOC (out of character) or out of game information. There are many
sources on roleplaying out there that you can read, but for now, try out
the following commands to help you act out your character.

Use "#6EMOTE#0" to create a custom action. The emote is a powerful tool,
and it will be one of your most used commands in the game. The syntax is
#6emote <text>#0. At any time, you can place the #6@#0 symbol in the
<text> to make your character's short description appear there. Try
inputting "#6emote With deft typing, @ manages to emote correctly!#0"

Use "#6THINK#0" to send your thoughts to the invisible storytellers in
the game. While no other players can see your thoughts, the story
administrators managing Atonement can use these thoughts to gain insight
on your character. As a player, it will also allow you to develop your
character's personality. The syntax is #6think <text>#0.

Use "#6FEEL#0" to send your feelings to the invisible storytellers in the
game. This works in the exact same way as THINK does.

Try all of the above commands for yourself. Once you're comfortable with
using them, input "#6NEXT#0" to proceed with the Atonement Newbie Guide!

(You can input "#6DONE#0" at any time to exit this guide.)

Newbie Guide: Looking at the Environment~
The "#6LOOK#0" command allows you to glean additional information on
objects and other pertinent things in your room. Just by inputting
"#6LOOK#0", you can see that:

1. This room is named "Newbie Guide: Looking at the Environment".

2. This room has no exits.

3. This room has a description that tells you any important information
concerning this room.

The look command can be used in the following manner:

"#6LOOK#0" to see where you are.

"#6LOOK <target>#0" to look at something.

"#6LOOK IN <container>#0" to look inside an object that you think
contains items inside, like corpses, bags, packs, pants, and so on.

In this room is #2a shapeless bag of polymesh#0. Try the commands, "#6look
bag#0" and "#6look in bag#0".

To proceed with the guide, input #6NEXT#0.

You can input "#6DONE#0" at any time to exit this guide.

Newbie Guide: Movement~
Before even thinking of movement, you should learn to be wary of your
surroundings. You will never know when a monster might be lurking too
close if you don't use the command "#6SCAN#0".

#6Scan#0ning will allow you to see who are in adjacent rooms. You will be
able to see mobiles or mobs (other players, monsters, etc) in those rooms.
You can scan in any direction as well, and it will allow you to peer a
couple of rooms in that direction. This is useful if you want to scout a
hallway, for example.

You might notice that the northern exit has a door attached to it, denoted
by (closed old-door). The door is named "old-door", and can be "#6OPEN#0"ed
or "#6CLOSE#0"ed accordingly. You can't scan or look through closed doors.
Some doors are locked or require other commands to pass through them.
Looking at those doors or any environmental cues will provide clues as to
how you might be able to enter them.

Movement is done by inputting "#6NORTH#0", "#6EAST#0", "#6SOUTH#0", "#6WEST#0",
and sometimes "#6LEAVE#0" or "#6ENTER <target>#0", when appropriate. You can
also just input #6n#0, #6e#0, #6s#0, #6w#0.

Try getting used to movement and then input "#6NEXT#0" to proceed.

(You can input "#6DONE#0" at any time to exit this guide.)

Newbie Guide: Character Positions~
Your character can perform basic actions to change his position. "#6SIT#0",
"#6STAND#0", "#6REST#0", "#6SLEEP#0", and "#6WAKE#0" all rely on each other.

If you're #6stand#0ing, you can move and otherwise do anything.

You can #6sit#0 on objects or tables via "#6sit <target>#0". This is relevant
if you wish to speak in private with another person. Sometimes, actions done
to you (such as binding wounds) require you to be seated. Be warned, though,
that sitting makes you helpless in combat.

#6Rest#0ing allows your character to recuperate by lying down or leaning on
something while staying awake. This is useful if you wish to recover from
your wounds while still interacting with others in your room.

#6Sleep#0ing prevents you from doing anything except for hearing some things
said in your room, but it allows you to recover from your wounds at a faster
rate.

Use #6wake#0 and #6stand#0 to get up from sleeping and go about once more.

Try getting used to these commands and then input "#6NEXT#0" to proceed.

(You can input "#6DONE#0" at any time to exit this guide.)

Newbie Guide: Cyan Game Prompts and the Helpline~
You may have noticed a pattern in how special commands in the game are
mentioned: they are colored #6cyan#0 and are in ALL CAPS.

Many other objects and locations will have these prompts. Leaving the gates
of town may require you to "#6CALL GATEGUARD#0", for example, or in entering
a secure clan room, one might have to "#6HANDSCAN <direction>#0".

Finally, you can ask questions over the in-game helpline. To do this, input
"#6HELPLINE <message>#0".
Try inputting: "#6helpline Greetings Atonement! I'm a new player.#0"

This ends the basic newbie guide. Input "#6DONE#0" to return to the guide

Newbie Guide: Your Character~
   Inputting "#6SCORE#0" will show you information about your character, the 
most relevant to how your character works being your attributes: 

-#6STR#0ength determines your maximum carry weight, what kind of weapons you 
can wield, and how much damage your melee attacks can deal. Weight is tied to 
encumbrance, which affects the rate at which you get tired. The higher your 
strength, then, the more armor you can wear. 

-#6DEX#0terity determines how high certain skills can increase, those skills 
being activities that are "hands on", such as all the weapon skills, deflect, 
and the crafting skills. 

-#6CON#0stitution is the measure of your physical health and stamina. How much 
damage you can take, and how long you can keep running before tiring is the 
purview of constitution. 

-#6INT#0elligence determines your total skill cap - how high the sum of your 
skills can be. It also determines how high your "thinking" skills can be. 

-#6WIL#0lpower determines how well you can do under pressure. Injuries prevent 
you from performing at your peak - willpower lowers the penalty. If your 
constitution is the measure of your bodily health, willpower is the measure of 
your mental health (trauma). Willpower also affects how high your 
"interaction" skills can be. 

-#6AGI#0lity affects your speed in combat, primarily. It also determines how 
high your skills relating to "movement" can be. 

Input "#6NEXT#0" to proceed to the discussion of skills. You can input 
"#6DONE#0" at any time to exit this guide.

Newbie Guide: Skills Overview~
   Skills determine what your character can do in the world. Whether he's a 
dual-wielding swordsman or a stealthy scavenger, you need to know how skills 
actually work to be able to make the most of them. Let's take a closer look: 

If character stats determine how high your skills can go, then its the level of 
your skills that determine how effective you are with your attempts. To check 
the levels of your skills, first type #6SKILLS#0. 

Skill levels range from: 

Beginner > Novice > Amateur > Familiar > Talented > Adroit > Master > Heroic > 
Legend 

Therefore, a character's accuracy with a long-blade is determined mostly by his 
long-blade skill (although there are other invisible variables when it comes to 
combat). A character improves his skill through use. Just like in real life, 
you don't learn as much when you do easy things or just do things you already 
know. 

Input #6NEXT#0 to proceed to the hunger and thirst section.

Newbie Guide: Hunger and Thirst~
   Hunger is a constant companion in the world of Atonement. Many will hunger 
for power, money, or love but all will hunger for food and thirst for water. 
The former needs may be unattainable but the latter are necessary for survival. 
Let's discuss #6HUNGER#0 and #6THIRST#0: 

In this game, hunger and thirst affect your skills to some extent. If you 
starve yourself, you'll be weak and kittenish, just like in real life. Until, 
of course, you just #6DIE#0 (colors added to denote importance and in this case 
badness). The -best- way to avoid dying from hunger or thirst... or simply 
being too weak to keep yourself alive is to eat and drink often. The more you 
starve and dehydrate yourself, the harder it is to 'catch up' and the more food 
and water you'll need to consume to get back to your best self. 

Food packets are your primary source of food although the lowest folk without 
family may resort to simply scooping vomit-tasting paste from a tub. Mmm, 
chopped up organic bits. Ideally, here's how it'll go: 

Gather animal corpses or fallen buddies -> Process corpses into tubs of food 
paste -> Process tubs of food paste into food packets -> #6"tear 
dried-packet"#0 

Read #6"Help Combine"#0 to learn more about the actual process of converting 
corpses into food. 

Input #6NEXT#0 to proceed to the second discussing encumbrance. 

You can input #6DONE#0 at any point to exit this guide.

Newbie Guide: Encumbrance~
   When you type #6SCORE#0, you will be told how much weight you are carrying, 
and your encumbrance. The levels of encumbrance are: 

unencumbered > lightly encumbered > encumbered > heavily encumbered > 
critically encumbered 

Your carry weight depends on your #6strength#0. The higher your strength, the 
more you need to carry to be encumbered. In relation, the more weight you can 
carry, the more heavy armor you can wear as well. 

Encumbrance affects the rate at which you lose stamina whenever you move or 
fight. When you reach encumbered status, you can no longer hide or sneak, and 
when you reach #6critically encumbered#0 status, you can no longer move. 

Plan your load according to your destination or task! 

The CHARACTER section of the Newbie Guide is finished. Input #6DONE#0 to 
return to the guide menu.

A Partially Clogged Pulmonary Vein~
   There is something wrong here. Though oxygen-rich blood pulses in from the 
lungs at a heady speed, the pressure in this rounded vein is heightened to 
almost painful degrees. A thick wall of lipids stacked mid-vein creates a 
barricade, impeding the travel from lungs to heart. With precious cargo 
chemically altering their makeup, those beautiful rich red oxygen-heavy blood 
cells dance and trickle past their obstruction but at a hindered clip. To the 
north, the throbbing of the heart can be heard, the lub-dub of valves opening 
and closing in time.

A Very Bright Place~
This is quite the simple room. It is large enough for a dozen or 
so people to reside in comfortably, but clearly has not been
created for the sake of comfort. The floors are constructed of a
fine steel, as are the walls, as is the ceiling, and as is the 
door. There is a simple steel chair sitting in the room's center,
and the only break in this rooms austerity is a magnificent,
blackened, and altogether immense throne. It is stylized after a
large mainframe, the core of which has unfortunately been torn
out. The sides and base are intact, with a few incut steps
leading up to an oversized electrical socket.

Inside a Human Heart~
   The thick walls of this heart shiver with electrical impulses dancing 
between each singular cell. The shape of this space is forever in flux. 
Constant steady thumping signals the opening and closing of the valves that 
guard each separate chamber. A steady current of blood rushes along in busy 
torrent, zipping in from a distant pair of lungs and out towards a body. 
Suspension in the ever-moving dark red-purple fluid brings an incredible 
pressure crushing in from every corner in constrict, only to be temporarily 
relieved when the muscle relaxes.

The Headbangers Volcano Cathedral!~
   Set in the middle of a giant volcano, this cathedral is carved in to the 
very rock itself! Festooned with vinyls and LP's of various quality, they make 
up the arched windows of this grand and monumental building. With firey 
brimstone and death lurking underfoot, a vast chasm of sulfurous fire and 
burning. Composed of fire-blackened stone, the building is a staggering in 
proportion and sits on a suspended island of rock, shackled to the very walls 
of the volcano!

A Child's Portrayl of the Apocalypse~
   This room has an eerie prescence in that it's walls are painted with 
childish images of prancing ponies, rainbows, and large amounts of flora. As 
it nears toward the end of the room opposite of the door, the painting take a 
macabre turn in that the ponies are leaping toward their deaths in a mass of 
carcasses. The pile, covered in amounts of blood and gore most would find 
unfathomable, shades the skinless mammals to expose the gruesome ideal of 
skinless animals trying to hoist themselves from their fates without success. 
The ceiling starts out as a vibrant sky blue with clouds, but nearing the end 
of the room focuses into a more sinister presence.

#6Newbie Guide: Inventories and You#0~
   Everything you have on your person makes up your inventory. When you type 
#6INVENTORY#0 you will see everything you are wearing or holding. 
#6EQUIPMENT#0 is another command to achieve this goal. Here are some other 
commands involving your inventory and how to use it best: 

There's only so much you can carry in your two hands, right? Well, that's what 
bags, boxes, barrels, even -babies- are created for... all of them have their 
own inventory. SO. Let's talk about how we get into those bags, boxes, 
barrels, etc. To start with, does your container have a lid? If so, you must 
#6OPEN#0 your container. Just remember, if at any point you don't want to have 
your container opened any longer, you can simply #6CLOSE#0 that very same 
container. As long as it has a lid! 

So, you've got your container opened and you want to get something out of it, 
hmm? Well, that's easy peasy. All you need to do is utilize the #6GET#0 
command. Though handy for picking up things on the ground, it's also useful 
for getting things from containers. Simply type #6GET (item) (container)#0. 
When you're done with the object, don't be afraid to put it right back using 
#6PUT (item) (container)#0. 

This part of the inventory guide is finished. Please type #6NEXT#0 to move on. 

You can input "#6DONE#0" at any time to exit this guide.

#6Newbie Guide: Commands Regarding Worn Items#0~
   There are a few commands you can use when adjusting your inventory. Some 
play into encumbrance, which we've already discussed. Let's go over these 
tools first: 

You will find #6EVALUATE#0 is a helpful command in many ways. Using the 
evaluate command, you not only receive information on where the item can be 
worn and how it can be used but also the weight of an item and in some cases 
how it would affect your skills. 

The wear command is helpful for equipping yourself properly. No one wants a 
naked newbie. So, let's practice this now. To wear your items, simply type 
#6WEAR (item)#0 There are a few cases where items can be worn on items, such as 
sheathes and pouches upon belts. To equip yourself with these items, type 
#WEAR (item) (item)#0. 

Once you've outfitted yourself with a sheath or a backstrap, or you've at least 
tucked your sword into your belt, you're now ready to wield your weapon. 
Simply using #6DRAW#0, you can draw whatever is first listed in a sheath, 
backstrap, or on your belt. Specify the item to draw a specific weapon in 
particular. After you've slaughtered a baby or postured manfully with a 
dagger, enter #6SHEATH#0 to return the weapon to where it came from. Just 
remember, you have two hands and two hands only. 

Input #6NEXT#0 to proceed to the second section involving inventories. 

You can input "#6DONE#0" at any time to exit this guide.

#6Targetting: The Bane of Newbie Existence#0~
   You have two skins in your pack. You want the second one, not the first 
one. Get skin pack gives you the first one over and over again until you want 
to sit down and cry. There's no call for tears. I promise. Here: 

To get the skin you -want- you will instead need to add the number denoting the 
skin in the list of skins you want, along with the skin itself. An example of 
this from our previous scenario? #6Get 2.skin pack#0. This will get the second 
skin from the pack. And suddenly there is no need to cry any longer. This 
should -not- be confused with get 2 skin pack, which will get two stacked 
together skins from the pack.

#6Newbie Guide: Accessories to Emoting#0~
   Quickly, let's discuss a few commands that can be used to define your pc: 

With #6DMOTE#0 - Dmote is used to define any changeable parts of your 
description. Your PC has managed to get themselves punched in the face. 
There's no reason to change your permanent description as this bruise will fade 
in time. But dmote can make it possible for you to describe this bruise just 
below your description so that those looking at you will be able to tell 
instantly that someone has socked you. 

Example - #6dmote#0 This man has a gigantic bruise over his right eye. <-- 
That bit of text will rest directly below your description. 

With #6PMOTE#0 - Pmote is used to alter your long description so that those who 
look in the room or enter the room will be able to easily identify what your PC 
is currently doing. 

Example - #6pmote#0 is standing near several others, leaning against a wall. 
To others, you will appear as (your sdesc) is standing near several others, 
leaning against a wall. 

With #6OMOTE#0 - Omote is used to alter the long description of an item that is 
currently on the ground. 

Example - #6omote#0 (item keyword) is resting on the edge of the sink. To 
others and even yourself after you've set it, it would appear as (item) is 
resting on the edge of the sink. 

Don't be afraid to use other commands to enhance your experience! By using the 
#6SET#0 combined with a variety of modifiers you can fight and move in many 
different ways. These modifiers can be seen by simply typing 'set'. 

Try getting used to these commands and then input "#6NEXT#0' to proceed. 

You can input "#6DONE#0" at any time to exit this guide and return to the guide 
menu.

Newbie Guide: Combat Commands~
   Now, if you're interested in fighting, as many people are, there are few 
options to consider. When you're moving to engage in combat code, it all 
depends on how you want the outcome to be that defines which command you use. 
The first, if you have plan of where you want to go with the fight, choose 
wisely. Here are some options: 

The two options for engaging combat are #6HIT#0 and #6KILL#0. The first, hit, 
will allow you to automatically accept the submission of the other party should 
they offer it at some point. And mobiles will react differently as well. This 
should always be used in a spar. In cases where you want a final death to 
happen, use the command kill. This will ensure that nothing outside of a 
mutual agreement to #6'STOP'#0. 

At any point during combat, as long as your character is on their game (not off 
balance), you can type #6'Strike (bodypart)'#0 to hit a particular area on your 
trying to hit. If you're not already -in- combat, the strike command works 
exactly like the hit command and does not allow you to aim for a specific 
location. opponent. Though you may hit less often, you'll more likely hit 
where you're 

Should you manage to kill something that constitutes healthy wildlife, it might 
be time to skin it. Wielding a smallblade weapon, you can type 'skin 
(corpse-you-want-to-skin)' or simply #6'SKIN'#0 to skin whatever corpses are in 
the room. 

When you're done reading, please input #6"NEXT"#0 to proceed.

Newbie Guide: Stealth and Stealth Combat~
   There are a few commands that can make it possible to move and attack 
unseen. Generally, you're going to want to pick #6HIDE#0 and #6SNEAK#0 in 
character generation. However, these skills can still be learned and anyone 
can manage to hide properly. The commands are as follows: 

With #6Hide#0 - This will hide your character from detection. When the purple 
(hidden) shows up on your screen, you're hidden so rejoice. You -must- be 
hidden to sneak successfully. 

To #6Kill (target)#0 using ambush - When hidden, you can attack and catch your 
target unaware. This is extremely powerful for those easily startled 
creatures, i.e. rats 

With #6Sneak#0 - When you've got your hide down, you can incorporate sneak into 
your movement. Sneak (direction) will, if successful, move you into a new room 
without detection. 

When you're done reading, please input "#6NEXT#0" to proceed.

Newbie Guide: Loading and Manipulation~
   To load your weapon, you need to establish a few things. Does your gun take 
a clip? Does it simply take rounds? Let's go over the different ways to load a 
weapon: 

If your weapon requires a clip, you first need to load ammo into your clip. 
Hold the bullets in one hand, the clip in the other. Type #6LOAD#0. After a 
few tics of the timer, you'll have a fully loaded clip (unless you didn't have 
enough bullets in which case you will have a partial and that status will be 
denoted by the short description of the clip). And -then- get your weapon in 
the now-free-hand. Type load again. The loaded clip will be loaded into your 
gun. And then the gun will be loaded. 

If your weapon doesn't require a clip, simply load the gun by holding the 
bullets in one hand and the gun in the other and type #6LOAD#0. 

There may be safeties and other conditions on your weapon before firing. Don't 
be afraid to type help modify to get a rundown on how to modify your weapon. 
Weapons (in this instance according to the helpfile) work somewhat like 
electronics when removing safeties.

Newbie Guide: Crafting Basics~
   Let's do a rundown on crafts and how you identify the crafts you can do: 

First off, to see your crafts, you need to type #6CRAFTS#0. Now that you've 
seen your crafts, you can look at the crafts in a particular group. To see 
what types of crafts you have available in each of the groupings shown when you 
type crafts, type crafts (group). The example we'd be using would be crafts 
general-food. This will show you all of the general-food crafts you know. To 
see what each craft takes, type #6MATERIAL (craftname)#0. For example, this 
would look like 'material dried-packet', if you were to look at the crafts for 
tearing a dried-packet. The directions for what you need -should- be clearly 
defined when you do this. 

As a secondary help, you can try to run the craft. Most crafts will tell you 
what you're missing. Be careful, there are a few that will use supplies 
without stopping. 

A way to see if a component is used in a craft you know is to use the 
#6examine#0 command, previously discussed in an earlier section. 

Congrats, you've finished your tutorial. There's a rich and diverse world to 
explore but hopefully you have enough tools to deal with the moon as it comes 
at you!

A Seedy Stripclub Entrance~
  The poorly-painted concrete wall here yields to a pair of red double doors, 
the entrance to a stripclub judging by the tacky neon sign flickering above it. 
The sign itself describes the silhouette of a naked woman straddling a chair 
backwards, with the letters SHOWBAR140 written alongside the picture. The 
gutter drain nearby gives off a horrid smell, and drunks stagger up and down 
the nearby street. Beyond the door the dull rumble of bass can be heard.

In an White Room with Infinite Bounds, Lined with Gunracks~
   This room stretches as far as the eye can see, there are no walls, corners, 
ceilings or a perceivable floor - It is entirely white. In this alternate 
reality, there are no shadows, just blinding white light in every direction. 
You stand in between massive steel weapon racks which stretch as far as the eye 
can see in each direction, which are lined with every imaginable firearm setup.

A Modest Reception Room~
   Massive dark ebony beams support this small reception area, the walls little 
more than translucent golden paper set upon smooth railings. Woven, 
natural-hued tatami mats are laid across the floor, looking freshly swept and 
in immaculate condition. There are no perceptible aromas to the room and even 
footsteps oddly seem to dissipate without sound. A convoluted candleabra of 
entangled thorned briars dangles from the ceiling just above the table, the 
endlessly flickering flames casting no shadows upon the walls. Against one 
wall is an elegant weapons rack, displaying several sheathed longswords of 
impressive quality and austere design. A thin, sliding door leads southwards, 
the only visible sign of an exit.

A Small Private Study~
   Although cramped in size, the sparse furnishings and the ceiling which is 
composed of a double-pane of clear glass creates the illusion of a larger 
space. The natural-hued tatami mats covering the floor are clean aside from a 
few unusual splatterings of red fluid tracking towards the wall, where they 
vanish. Small antique lanterns dangle from ebony support posts, the flickering 
candles within casting foreboding shadows along the golden paper walls. A 
crimson futon has been pushed into one corner, the unused blankets sitting on 
top enclosed in the original flimsy plastic case. A slender wooden door on 
sliding rails to the north appears to be the only entrance and exit.

Atonement Conference Theatre~
   Set in the area is a spacious clearing that could well contain a large 
amount of people. In a semi-circle along the southern side of the hall, twelve 
rows of plush seats rise progressively higher until the highest can oversee the 
entire amphitheatre. Facing the seats is an elevated platform with a podium, 
covered by scaffolding that supports stage lighting. 

If someone is holding the special 'speaker' object, no one else may speak or 
emote. Please do not take the object anywhere else. Thank you.

   All around you lies a perfect white space without blemish, contour or form. 
There is no ground, no sky, and therefore no horizon. There is no sense of 
distance or volume in all of its vast infiniteness. It would be impossible to 
tell if it went on forever or ended an arm's reach away.

An ancient, Victorian study~
   Faded grey planks, once a golden brown hue, mesh together to form this 
study's floor, warped and no longer in perfect alignment. The lower-half of 
the walls have been composed of a similar wood, though darker and with broader 
planks, the rest is covered in torn dark-green paper, its simple patterns still 
present. Every so often, a stone sconce protrudes from the wall, a large 
candle flickering dutifully in its grasp. The ceiling seems to be formed of 
domed marble, with a grand chandelier dropping down from the center.

Saxo's Moon Landing Studio~
   This is an old-fashioned film studio. On a slightly raised area is a bed of 
fine, greyish sand spread carefully in softly rippling dunes. Little has 
disturbed this surface save for a few deep footprints, the patterns suggesting 
heavy, furrow-soled boots. In one end of this area is a model of a spaceship's 
landing capsule about the size of a washing machine, standing on a series of 
angular legs. Radar equipment has been arrayed around it while a flag has been 
stuck into the sand some meters away. Cameras and stage lights surround this 
area on three sides, and the background is a painting of space and Earth's full 
form.

Inside a Cryo-Pod~
   Ice cold and cramped, this circular space seems roughly large enough to fit 
a single adult person and little else. The walls are crafted from some faintly 
glowing material, soft to the touch and casting an eerie light upon anything it 
may contain. A large stalk bearing a tube snakes down from the ceiling, purple 
nutrients within the tube visible past the clear plastic. A few nozzles seem 
to have retracted into the wall of the chamber, their purpose not obvious by 
their shape.

The Moon~
   Shelves stacked with thick manuals, jars brimming with colourful holodiscs, 
and sleek, flatscreen display panels line the curving walls of this spherical 
chamber. The displays show real-time images of Atlas ship systems, structural 
schematics, and what appear to be topographical readings of Mars and Luna. The 
floor is transparent, allowing a top-down view of the GC Remembrance Chamber. 

A round rug, ten feet in diameter, has been placed here to delineate space for 
seating and a large, circular drafting console that doubles as a coffee table.

The Velvet Room~
   This room is quite large, and though the room has tall walls adorned with 
intricate gold designs, the room is very plainly adorned. The carpet is a 
royal, purple velvet in color, and the walls themselves, behind the golden 
designs, have also been covered in the color. The air is somewhat musky 
smelling, as if the room isn't used very often. There is just one door in the 
room, leading to the east, and is more or less a wooden board set into the 
wall.

New Room~
   The flat dark grey paint only adds to the bleak surroundings apparent even 
in this old guard station. The fore wall may have once housed a set of 
electronic consoles, but all that remains is a few twisted shards of metal 
where it once laid. Rubberized flooring beneath the feet is almost black in 
color, lightened by the ages of dust that have accumulated here. The 
furnishings have been ripped out, leaving a lackluster and empty space.  

   The port door is labeled "#6Senior Corrections Officer#0", although the 
plaque is hanging at a loose angle from rusty bolts.

A Narrow Room with a Slanted Off-White Ceiling~
   Beige ceilings and walls enclose this second story room, with odd angles and 
corners. The inward slant of the ceiling starts only a couple of feet from the 
teal carpeting in the northern and southern sides of this room, while a hall 
extends to the east, and a wall stands to the west. Windows have been set into 
the western wall and another in the southern ceiling as a skylight, both only 
about a foot wide. Snaking along the ceiling, a painted ventilation duck runs 
through the room and into the adjourning spaces, matching the color of the 
walls.

Floating Amongst Debris in Space~
   Gently floating debris drifts through this opened area of space into the 
endless void. Without gravity or friction to interfere, these bits of metal 
and plastic spin and gently float unhindered. What remains of the vessel the 
bit of shrapnel has come from seems to have dispersed, save for small bits here 
floating around a large chunk, big enough to fit an entire room. As though 
bitten off of a ship, the jagged corners of this section of wall is closed off 
by a metal bulkhead.

Within the Shattered Remains of a Comm-Closet ~
   Nestled in the confines of this small space, multitudes of wires, colored a 
wealth of shades floats freely about. Glimpses of the darkness of space beyond 
can be seen from the many holes and rips out of the metal walls and ceiling, 
making it obvious this small room is detached from where ever it initially 
belonged. Soft rubberized floor, and broken plastic ceiling lighting is the 
only indicator left to which direction was intended as the floor.

A Clean, Well-Lighted Place~
   Spacious and well-maintained, this room is vaguely hexagonal in shape. 
Heart-shaped lanterns hang from the high ceiling and the walls are dressed with 
a fancy wallpaper. Highly detailed clouds and thick, grassy meadows decorate 
the walls and the southern door blends into the display. The floor is carpeted 
with a lush, green carpet that is soft and fuzzy to the touch. In the center 
of the room is a wooden pen, painted white. Corgi puppies of all colors and 
sizes frolick within.

A Secret Snick Den~
   This structure is built entirely of living branches that have been woven 
together to create a wide dome, more than large enough to stand. The top 
tapers up almost to a point to allow the chimney of a black pot-bellied stove 
to protrude from it and the walls are uneven, twigs bearing the occasional 
leaf. The ground is covered with piles of rather threadbare Persian rugs and 
is scattered with cushions covered in raw, rough silk while stacks of books 
stand around rather haphazardly.
