Squalid Outlands Encampment~
   This desolate little encampment has been crudely fashioned from the 
surroundings, the native terrain barely transformed by some sheets of polyprop 
and hangings of polymesh draped positioned in to a roughly circular shape. In 
the middle of said shape, a number of dingy piles of cloth scrap, evidently 
sleeping rolls, have been arranged, along with assorted knick-knacks such as 
knives, discarded casings, and miscellaneous parts of animals.
