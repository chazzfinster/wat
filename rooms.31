A Barren Holding Bay~
   The holding bay expands out from the aft to the fore of the 
ship, and is easily the largest room on this deck. It stands 
about a story and a half high, and measures to be approximately 
seventy or so yards in width and lengh. A large, air-locked door 
is set in the port wall with a faded label warning others to 
avoid opening the door at all costs. To the starboard, a small 
set of stairs leads the way to a rounded door with a small wheel 
mounted in it's center. Aside from the odd cargo box and other 
piece of heavy machinery bolted down to the floor, the bay is 
rather empty and dull. 

  While there's nothing wrong with staying aboard the ship,
it would probably be best if you went ahead and boarded 
the space station to #6ENTER#0 the #6ADVENTURE#0.

Port End of a Hangar~
   The massive hangar halts here at a pair of behemoth sliding 
doors, opening like an eyelid might. A series of massive 
tendrils, gear-like protrusions and form a complicated system 
necessary for opening the doors. The architecture is undeniably 
foreign, the material that comprises the hangar being of a 
strange orange metallic material that glistens, as though the 
very walls sweat. Spiraling catwalks surround and enclose the 
area, and the floor itself is strangely barren of anything - no 
equipment at all.

Starboard End of a Hangar~
   This hangar is massive compared to the rest of the rooms on 
this deck it stands a full two and a half stories in height and 
over two hundred yards in width and length, conforming to the 
hexagonal shape of the deck. A massive door is set in the aft 
wall, strange white glyphs skittering across the surface of it, 
flashing with their own light. Spiraling catwalks surround and 
enclose the area, and orange tendril-like cables - are attached 
to a series of complicated block-and-tackle systems. Aside from 
the thick layers of dust covering many of the hoses and cables 
that clutter the area, they all seem to be in a fair state of 
repair.

Inside a Circular Shaft, Below a Vessel~
   This circular shaft is suddenly stopped by some sort of 
cylindrical vessel - or rather the translucent bottom of it. The 
metallic vessel appears to perfectly fit within the shaft and is 
set within the shaft-beams, leaving no empty space in the

for they are made out of a dusky glassy material. The air is

towards the low ceiling becomes until nothing but darkness 
surrounds them, and the rank stench of rotten and rapidly 
decaying corpses nearly overwhelm the senses. The unleveled 
floor is slick with old blood, new blood, and unknown bodily 
fluids. The skeletal remains of animals of all sizes have been 
strewn about the area, separated in literally every way 
imaginable. Not a single corpse retains all of it's body parts - 
or even its flesh. 

   Countless layers of spiderwebs to create a massive network 
that blocks the stretch of near pitch-black corridor to the fore, 
dust filling the gaps between the talons, beaks, feathers, 
intestines and various fleshy appendages of questionable origins 
entangled within it's webbing.

   This glass tank is enormous in size, enough to fit a whale if 
need be. It is at least twenty feet in height, and fifty feet in 
length. What must have been a marine tank has long been left 
unattended, and the water level has evaporated to about a human's 
height. Whatever it once held appears to have long decayed; 
skeletons of sea turtles, fish, sharks and all manner of marine 
organisms float in the scummy, fetid water. Long rusted 
tendril-like cables hang overhead, fallen in disrepair, and

A Cavern-like Tunnel~
   The passageway here resembles a cavern tunnel than any 
hallway; while the floor is level, it winds roughly as a 
naturally formed path might, and tall orange-red spires run from 
floor to ceiling like pillars. More markings are etched all over 
the spires, in greater fervor and frequency, with no apparent 
pattern or order. They glow not at all, a lifeless black against 
the red-orange. In the likeness of a rib cage, or the claws of 
an animal reaching skyward, pronounced ridges form the walls and 
shoot upward toward the ceiling.

A Circular, Complex Wired Dome~
   This room is a circular dome with a complex network, much like 
a spider web, of tendril-wires that criss-cross every which way 
through the ceiling. The floor itself is flat and orange metal 
bare. An array of spires surround the perimeter of the room, 
glowing with white symbols and flickering screens made out of a 
dusky glass. Notably a half of the dome is completely 
transparent, as though it were laid bare to the black void of 
space - if it weren't that should one attempt to reach beyond, it 
is stopped by a glassy material.

A Gutted Tunnel, Before an Immense Spiral~
   Here the passageway comes to an utter halt by an immense 
spiraling track, winding down down down in a dizzying display of 
architecture. The patterns of the ridges are different, snaking 
along with the spiral as to coil like a snake, wrapping its way 
ever downward to no visible end. A flat circular platform of 
orange metal sits at the base of the spiral, set into the grooves 
of the spiral. There are no glowing symbols save one right above 
the platform, a glowing eye-like marking. The ceiling has been 
gutted, a large hole evident, as though someone or something 
ripped its way through.

When the puller uses the keyword INITIATE PLATFORM, the rpprg should drop them into room 31070. There should be a considerable delay while they're in 31070, before it drops them into 31042. Reason being, we want nasty spiders following them down the spiral and attacking them as they make their escape. When they're dropped into 31042, there should be a rprog that tells them the platform has slowed down, malfunctioned, stopped.

for an eternity down the port. Massive pillars extend out from 
the sides of the level floor and arc upwards towards the low 
ceiling up above like the claws of an animal reaching up for the

This is a somewhat difficult electronics check to see if the emergency hatch will open. Maybe say, three failed electronics checks will open it anyway. Puller should take moderate damage each time they fail - they get electrocuted or some such. Once the hatch opens, obj 31014 (the oblong discloration) should be replaced by obj 31015 (an opened oblong discoloration).

hatch~
Players should be able to type EXIT HATCH to get abroad the Flying Mary and make their grand escape. I'm thinking there should be some delay, IE, "You struggle and gasp for breath as your equipment barely sustains you in the cold vacuum of space." - "You fight for every inch, scrambling to pull yourself abroad the Flying Mary." etc. Maybe make them roll CON to see if they get abroad, or die in space. Once the previous rprog has triggered, animals should totally start flying into the cold depth of space and die. (Mobs get flushed out of the room or something.)

   This darkened stretch of corridor continues on from the bend 
in passageways to the aft to the fore, though the collapsed 
ceiling prevents further progress in that direction; a 
reddish-orange hued, oblong-shaped discoloration in the starboard 
wall is barely discernible in the starboard wall. Massive 
pillars extend out from the sides of the level floor and arc 
upwards towards the low ceiling up above like the claws of an 
animal reaching up for the sky. Faint etchings of strange,

Inside a Circular Shaft~
   This circular shaft is a vertical drop, apparently made of yet 
more of the same orange metallic material. Thick ridges run up 
all along the shaft, interrupted only by two beams on opposite 
ends. Fine little indents, upon closer inspection, are seen on 
the beams - reminiscent of gears. An oblong light discoloration 
of orange is set on the side of the shaft. Strangely, there is 
not a single symbol to be found on the discoloration. The air 
becomes thick and moist in here, as though the air itself was 
sweating. 
   Notably there is a torn opening on the side of the wall, 
seemingly leading into a vent.

adorn the surface of each spire, in increasingly greater fevor

A Cramped Mess Room~
   The mess hall is quite literally -- a mess. Many metallic 
surfaces about the room are cluttered with a wide variety of 
equipment and non-descript items; magazines, the remains of 
rations, dismantled firearms, and even a couple of pornography 
magazines with "mysterious" stains coating the cover. A couple 
sets of bunk beds have been pushed off to the side of the massive 
room, leaving plenty of room for the benches and couches set up 
at the center.

The Cockpit~
   With a slightly vaulted ceiling with several large, 
darkly-colored ventilation vents placed in strategic areas, the 
cockpit has a surprisingly spacious feel to it despite it's 
compact size. Three separate consoles dot the area, each one's 
surface filled with hundreds of different colored controls, 
gauges and panels. A small set of stairs nestled between two of 
the stations leads down to the expansive floor below where the 
port walls and ceiling meet the massive panels of tinted glass 
that provide a stunning view of outter space.

The Black Void of Space~
   It would be easy to say that space is cold, mind-numbingly, 
icy cold - and dark. It is cold and it is dark. It is 
absolutely frigid. Chunks of debris, pieces of hull, even the 
jagged breach itself - these are also cold, achingly cold. But 
they would not feel cold if touched, and anyone in space would 
not feel that deep, bone-shattering freeze. Anyone in a 
pressurized spacesuit would not feel the chill at all, and anyone 
not so dressed would have more pressing issues at hand: the water 
on their skin would evaporate first, their eyes would shrivel, 
and they would prune like a raisin left too long in the sun. 
Ninety seconds without oxygen and their lungs would shred. With 
oxygen, unsuited, it's a slow death: blood loss and organ 
failure. 
   Still, the view is nice.

A Circular Watchtower~
   This circular watchtower can comfortably fit two men abreast, 
about seven feet in diameter. It is protected by a steel roof 
and encircling railing, giving some relief to the harsh elements. 
Serving its purpose, the watchtower provides a clear view of the 
endless Moon plains below, and the dark pools of Crater Lake to 
the south.

By a Concrete Stairwell~
   This facility is reminiscent of a very old cave, a concrete

walls are just utilitarian concrete: bare and cold and damp. A 
murmuring of water pervades the air of the hallway, echoing off 
the stone walls from deeper within the facility. This circular 
hallway bends, leading west to south, while to the northeast 
corner a slippery concrete stairwell leads up to a bent and 
ancient-looking hatchway.

A Dingy Dining Hall~
   This long hall, like most of everything in this facility, is 
simple but damp; it is devoid of any ornamentation, leaving the 
cold concrete walls bare, save for waterstains and mold near the 
corners. Sectioned out by a long metal counter, the remnants of 
a scavenged kitchen lie at the wester end. The rest of the room 
is lined with long, rusted metal tables and benches.

A Collapsed End of the Hallway~
   The walls here have given in and collapsed, rendering any 
further movement to the south impossible. The musty old smell of 
mold and water is strong here, and the source is likely the damp, 
squishy green growth on the collapsed rubble of the walls and 
roof. On one wall, dull red letters spell "EXIT" with an arrow 
point in the direction of the blocked-off tunnel.

   This facility is reminiscent of a very old cave, a concrete

and water, unmasked by anything but the passage of time. The 
walls are just utilitarian concrete: bare and cold and damp. A 
murmuring of water pervades the air of the hallway, echoing off 
the stone walls from deeper within the facility. Here the 
hallway ends, with two doorways at either end. Above either door 
are patches of the concrete less worn than the rest, in the vague 
shape of letters, now unreadable. Scattered about the walls here 
are pockmarks and bulletholes, the tell-tale remnants of a 
long-ago gunfight. Here and there are stains of dull red, 
perhaps blood. 
   The door to the door to the southern room is missing, stripped 
from its frame and hauled away.

A Small, Cramped Bathroom~
   Few of the tiles remain from what used to make up the flooring 
of this tiny bathroom, but those that do are shattered and strewn 
about the concrete floor. Pipes jut awkwardly out from the floor 
and walls in some places: where the toilet and sink once stood. 
To one side there is a raised platform, surrounded by panels of 
cracked, cloudy glass: the shower room, yet the showerhead is 
missing.

   This walls of this room are just like all the others: that 
cold, unfeeling concrete, yet in here they were, at one point no 
doubt long ago, better kept in terms of cleanliness. Bunk beds 
are bolted to the floor at random increments, and holes in the 
floor suggest at one point they dominated the room. Bullet holes 
are present here as well, as well as the odd casing or two left 
forgotten in the corner.

A Run-Down, Cannibalized Lounge~
   This square lounge looks designed to fit only ten people 
comfortably at any one time. It has been completely 
cannibalized, and poorly refurbished. The white polyprop that 
were padded on the walls for some semblance of decoration has 
been all but torn down, and only small strips here and there 
remain stuck on the walls. Now, preserved heads of wildlife - 
even a gray small horned lizard - litter the walls like an 
afterthought. The red carpeted flooring, more of a puke-brown, 
is torn and nonexistent at some portions and spotted with mold, 
even.

and that, from wall to wall and floor to ceiling. The air is 
heavy with humidity and a trickling of liquid can be heard 
nearby, just audible over the constant murmur of water from

A Wide and Damp Metal Room Before a Massive, Canabalized Generator~
   This room, unlike the others of the facility, is forged of 
metal, now long rusted and, in some places, warped. A thin 
coating of a slime-like substance coats the floor. This portion 
of the room is dominated by a huge cylindrical hunk of metal, 
like a massive soda-can. It is now but a shell of iron-alloy, 
rusted like everything else here, with but a few handfuls of 
discarded, useless wiring or gears dropped in the puddle formed 
in the base. A wire-mesh fence encircles the hulking thing, but 
one side has collapsed, rendering it useless as far as blocking 
any passage. Around it, dull red letters read "DANGER: HIGH 
VOLTAGE" and a crimson control booth is stationed nearby.

At a Four-Way Intersection~
   This facility is reminiscent of a very old cave, a concrete 
one at that. It smells musty and old, like eons-old chemicals 
and water, unmasked by anything but the passage of time. The 
walls are just utilitarian concrete: bare and cold and damp. A 
murmuring of water pervades the air of the hallway, echoing off 
the stone walls from deeper within the facility. Here the 
hallway opens to a four-way intersection.

A Side Room with a Hatch to the Pipes Below~
   This is a bare square side room, devoid of anything save for a 
few rust-ridden pipes and ruined wiring scattered about the 
floor. The word "MAITENANCE" is painted in faded red letters on 
one wall. From the circular hatchway leading to the pipes below, 
the loud murmur of running water issues forth, echoing loudly off 
the walls. Mold and slime are patched here and there, though the 
rungs of the rusted ladder to below are pratically coated with 
the gunk.

Before an Archway and Ruined Blast-Doors~
   This is a wide, open concrete room, and for good reason; a 
huge archway looms to the east, where once two smooth, massively 
thick blast doors, made of heavy iron-alloys, stood. Now but one 
of the doors is swung open and mostly intact save for rust, but 
the other has been blown down; the tell-tale black blastmarks of 
explosive charges run up the side of both the door and the frame 
where hinges used to hold the door in place. The entrance was at 
one point armed and protected to the teeth, but now the catwalks 
above have been cast to the ground, rust and strain having 
damaged their supports too greatly, and only the base of what 
were once gun turrets remain.

   Raw sewage runs with the water, mold and abnormal growths all 
along the walls on either side. The resulting density is 
sludge-like, and swimming through this patch of the tunnel would 
be quite a task, even for the most accomplished swimmers. A 
ruined sewer grate sits to the east, blocking any passage that 
way, but allowing a tiny trickle of light and fresh air inside. 
The pipe continues on to the west, growing ever-darker.

   The pipe continues to grow narrower here before it ends, 
connecting to an pipe above from which it would seem the majority 
of the waste underfoot has fallen, allowing no passage further 
into it's stinky depths. The ceiling raises here, and if one 
were to climb the heap of sewage and garbage beneath the pipe, a 
bit of air could be taken. Not fresh by any means, but air 
nonetheless. The smell here is horrific.

Along the Southern Perimeter~
   This strip of moon plain is barricaded by a three feet thick 
concrete wall and wire-mesh fencing. To the direct stands a 
blocky concrete building, dwarfing everything around it and 
rising to two stories tall. A low hum can be faintly heard from 
within. The ground below is hard, like packed dirt. A small 
staircase and a gray reinforced door leads inside the building.

Before Massive Double-Doors~
   The concrete wall abates slightly, allowing more room for what 
seems to be the main entrance. Smooth gray double doors bar 
entrance into the building to the east, and it is not without 
protection - huge klaxons and swiveling gun turrets are stationed 
around it. There is a tall black security booth to the left of 
the double blast doors.
