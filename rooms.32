Security Checkpoint~
   The road rolls in from east to west, narrow and clean and 
black, smooth asphalt as far as the eye can see. As it nears the 
airport to the west, however, it runs into a chain-link perimeter 
fence, topped with razor wire, and a high metal gate. A 
fortified, concrete booth sits to one side of the gate, and 
cameras have been mounted in various angles across it.

Along a Road Leading to an Airport~
   Past the perimeter fence and security checkpoint, this road 
runs in a flat, straight line toward the airport, bordered on 
either side by barren, grassless fields. Signs line the road 
along the way, standing more or less alone and warning in no 
uncertain terms that #1DANGER#0 might be found in the 
#1MINEFIELDS#0 bordering that black asphalt.

A Parking Lot~
   This parking lot is, like the road that leads into it, black 
asphalt and not very large. Parking spaces are divided by thin, 
white lines painted onto the flat, level space and there is 
relatively little debris on the lot itself. Just past this 
relatively small parking lot, to the immediate west, is a squat 
gray building. A short gravel path leads from parking lot to 
building. The building is accessible through two swinging, gray 
metal doors.

Lobby, Reception Area~
   The first thing immediately visible through the double doors 
is a faux-wood, plastic reception desk. It has been fixed to the 
floor and seems as much an integral part of the room as the walls 
and ceiling. Branching off from this plain room are several 
hallways, one of which seems to lead to a stairwell, making this 
an intersection of sorts. Like all good waiting rooms, it has 
benches lined along the walls.

in all it is absolutely unmemorable. The walls are rough to the

not dirty.

A Carpeted Conference Room~
   Though not clean enough to be called sterile, this room is 
nonetheless quite clean and, unlike much of the rest of the squat 
building, seems to have been constructed with a degree of comfort 
and sophistication in mind. The floor is not tiled but is 
covered completely by a short, soft, blue carpet and the walls 
are a mild, soft doe brown. The center of the room is dominated 
by a single, large oaken conference table.

   This small room is lined on all sides by shelving and smells 
strongly of dust. Various things sit on these shelves, or pile 
around on the floor beside them, including signal flags, hoses, 
folded fluro-orange uniforms and signal batons. A spiderweb sits 
in one corner, high along the wall by the ceiling, and a dead 
spider has curled up in its center.

Stairway Leading Down~
   This side of the lobby looks almost identical to its other 
half: plain, drab, boring. The floor, walls and ceiling are all 
uniformly off-white and recessed a few feet from the room is an 
arch, and through that arch is a stairway. Concrete stairs lead 
down from this far end of the lobby into a slightly damper, 
darker room below. A door leads outside, to the west, from here.

   This bathroom is fairly stark and absolutely simple. It has 
white tiled floors, walls, and a white-washed ceiling. There is 
a long line of white countertop stretching across the far wall 
and the sinks set into that are also white: white handles, white 
basin. Bathroom stalls line the other walls, as do several 
urinals and a baby changing station. High above is a single 
solitary smoke detector. A sign by the door warns that smoking 
is prohibited.

otherwise the room is sparsely decorated and bland.

the wall here, several pointing left, one up, and one right.
