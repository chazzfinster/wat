In the Cabin of a Phoenix-2 Stealth Helicopter~
   The back cabin of the stealth chopper is cluttered with 
equipment and crudely-designed seats, some of which lack 
harnesses entirely. The insides of the cabin's metal walls are 
painted in three different shades of camoflouged green and 
decorated in standard military fashion. The hatch doors on one 
side of the cabin are open, providing enough room for perhaps two 
men to #6JUMP OUT#0 while standing side-by-side. Frigid wind 
whips in from the opening and brings with it a wint'ry mist.

At the Base of a Lonely Hill Amongst the Himalayan Mountains~
   A tall, steep hill rises up from this rocky base, still easily 
dwarfed by the almost mythic presence of the surrounding Himalyan 
mountainside. Little grass grows in this craggy wasteland, and 
the earth is turned up unevenly at several points, causing travel 
to prove treacherous. An old, dirt road stretches eastward from 
here, in the direction of a fire-fight; that way, explosions 
light up the night in a relentless rhythm. Further up on the 
hill is a large compound, accessable by a boot-beaten path up the 
crag-land.

At the Edge of a Dangerous Firefight~
   War is Hell. This pitched battle proves nothing less, leaving 
behind its share of mangled corpses, burnt husks of tanks and a 
permanent scar upon the earth that is being fought over between 
the Pan-Asian soldiers and the Russian Federation.

Halfway Up the Steep Hillside~
   The unlevel path up and down the Himalayan hillside is dangerous. Rocks are 
icy and loose, and blankets of snow oftentimes sweep downward at apparently 
random intervals. From here, one could spot the base of the hill below, the 
military compound set into the side of the hilltop, or the kingly mountains 
that dominate the view by both day and night.

Before a Fortified Building at the Top of the Hill~
   The compound that stands at the top of the steep hill is old; 
its walls appear worn and beaten by the elements' fury, the 
structure of the building seems at risk as it leans back against 
the side of the hill that it rests on, and the roof mostly-broken 
shingles slap into one another with the continuous onslaught of 
the mountainous wind. 
   However, the hatch blastdoor that leads into the compound, 
while not the most modern of designs, is certainly far newer than 
the rest of the visible building. Sharp spotlights shine down 
from the roof of the building to light the area before the 
compound intensely with a broad, white glow.

An Abandoned Lobby~
   This lobby has been stripped of any furniture or decor that 
may have once existed here. It is an empty, open space. Many 
mud-tracks left by boots cover the floor itself, mostly heading 
north; beyond that, the room is barren of anything particularly 
of interest. The north end of the lobby is dark, though a single 
overhead lamp dimly lights this area as it swings slowly back and 
forth at the force of movement from the floor above.

A Three-way Split in the Hall~
   Here at the end of the lobby, there is a hall that splits off 
into two directions. The corridor widens a little heading 
eastward and narrows slightly as it stretches westward. The 
structural integrity of the walls here seem questionable, and the 
ceiling above the 'T'-shaped crossing is threatening to cave in. 
The floors are dirty, boot-tracks heading westward, though they 
seem to be thinner than they are to the south.

A Loudly Humming Corridor~
   The corridor here is wide. Compared to much of the rest of 
the old compound, the wall and ceiling here are well-kept; 
infact, in several places on the east-side of the hall here, old 
wooden structure has been re-supported with steel plating. At 
the end of the hallway, a thick and sealed blastdoor cuts off 
passage any further eastward. 
   Flourescent floor lamps are set neatly along the bottom of 
both sides of the hall in just this section of corridor, ending 
at the eastern door.

A Wide, Quiet Corridor~
   The corridor here is still wide, but it continues to narrow 
over moreso as it stretches westward. Boot-tracks stain the 
floor with mud and much of the lime plaster is crumbling on both 
walls. To the east is the northernmost end of an expansive 
lobby.

The Hallway's Dead End into a Set of Broken Doors~
   The hallway ends narrowly on its western end. The boot-tracks 
that cake the floor of the corridor with mud stop at a set of 
double-doors set into the northern wall. The doors themselves 
are left slightly ajar, and the left-most door's wooden plane is 
splintered and it hangs slightly off of its hinges.

A Crumbling Section of the Long Corridor~
   The corridor north of the broken set of double-doors is 
falling apart in a literal sense. Part of the ceiling has 
collapsed in, and plaster has accumulated in piles along both 
sides of the wall, exposing the rot-wood skeleton of the hall's 
precarious infrastructure. The mud tracks seem to thin out here 
and disappear, though most of the boot imprints appear to be 
leading northwards.

The First Floor's Northwestern Corner~
   At the northwestern corner of the compound's innards, the

and southward. On the eastern corner, just before the corridor 
snakes to the east, a large chunk of wood and plaster has been 
violently knocked out of the wall at about the level of a short 
man's eyes.

A Bloodied Stretch of Corridor~
   The corridor here stretches eastward and westward. There can 
be no doubt that a very recent fire-fight has nearly collapsed 
this section of the hall entirely, and the gruesome stains of 
dead men still line the ruined walls on both sides. In some 
places, gore has even managed to taint the ceiling itself, which 
has yet to fall inward on top of its crumbling support.

   The corridor is extremely narrow at this point and southward,

   The passage is extremely narrow in both directions here. It 
snakes around piles of plaster and rubble, and several wooden 
beams that are leaning outward and away from their proper place 
along their respective walls; the walls themselves threaten to 
cave inward, and in some places, they do to a limited extent.

wood exposed by crumbling plaster is supported by thick, steel 
plates. Large bolts punch through both wood and chinks in the 
steel, secured on the unseen, other side of the southern wall.

   On the southern side of this area is the base of a metal 
staircase; the stairs themselves appear to be almost made of 
scrap metal, and even without being climbed, they shiver and 
clank unhealthily. On the western side of the room is a thick, 
sealed blastdoor preventing passage further that way. To the 
north is a narrow opening that leads off into a corridor. 
Overhead light sprays down from above, playing with the shadows 
of this area.

   At the southern end of this corridor junction is the top of a

completely bare apart from two details, a pair of oblong lights 
encased in thick plastic that spread a dim, uneasy light on 
either side of a rickety metal staircase to the south. Looking 
up, the top of the staircase can barely be seen, apparently 
leading to an old looking metal door.

ceiling seem passable here, though any weight on the floor causes 
its wood to groan in an uncomforting manner.

A Large Room, Littered with Blueprints~
   This room is large and falling apart, structurally. The 
southeastern corner of the room has caved in almost entirely. 
There are a few makeshift tables here, created by stacking 
rotting wood up to the waist level of a man. Tacked to the walls 
and laying on the would-be tables are blueprints; indeed, the 
diagrams and graphs and equations are everywhere, dominating the 
room. They show complex mathematical algorhythms and sketches of 
reactors with pristine care taken to the work presented. Many of 
the blueprints are headed with the title 'Permanent Energy 
Solution Reactor', though some of the more obscure and unfinished 
diagrams lack any heading at all. On the southern end of the 
room is a large, hanging lamp that casts a stark light across the 
room; it is set just off to the side of the doorway.

On the Rooftop Helicopter Landing Pad~
   The top of the compound extends to a large helicopter pad. 
Howling winds from the mountains come rushing downs at all hours 
of the day, biting and whipping at those who dare set foot out in 
the cold. A set of dim, white lights encircle the landing pad to 
make sure it is seen even in the darkest of nights. The entire 
roof is built out of solid concrete and there's only one way out 
of here, a rusted steel hut with a simple but strong looking 
metal door at the east side of the rooftop. 
   Spotlights are set up around the perimeter of the roof, giving 
off enough light to dimly push back at the night around the 
helipad.
