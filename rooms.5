The Interior of a Hovercopter~
   Large enough to uncomfortably fit twenty-four armed and 
armored soldiers, the interior of this aircraft is built for 
function over form. Two rows of benches line either side of the 
aircraft, spaced evenly apart to allow a kevlar-clad soldier, and 
his kit enough room to breathe and little else. The side-door is 
home to a rather imposing, mounted machine-gun, chain-fed and 
easily fired on anyone unlucky enough to aggravate its operator. 
The cockpit is secured by a sturdy titon door, kept locked except 
on the rarest of occasions.

Hovercopter Cockpit~
   With metal underfoot, it is possible to walk past strapped 
seats for the pilot and co-pilot to approach the control panel. 
It's covered in dials, gauges, and all other sorts of 
instruments. A modified control, similar to a joystick with 
grips, is set off to the left middle enabling the craft to be 
controlled. Past this, the cockpit looks out through a thick 
windshield that is either glass or plastic, into the space 
beyond. Behind the cockpit is a sturdy, titon-steel wall, 
complete with a thick, heavy door that is almost always closed 
and locked.
