A Landing at the Top of the Stair~
   The stairs end at a landing here, the steps giving way to a 
solid steel floor. Towards the port side of the ship the uniform 
walls continue as a hallway, penetrating into the center of the 
ship. Towards the aft of the ship the stairwell continues, 
climbing into the metallic innards of the ship. The stair is 
littered with the debris of a broken barricade, but is passable 
downwards to the landing below from here.

A Demolished Waiting Room~
   This wide area is a hootenanny of destruction, with bits of 
metal thrown all about. What was once probably a hallway punches 
further to the north, now little more than a mangled tunnel. A 
blastdoor is set into the southern wall, but it has been wedged 
so that opening it would prove all but impossible. Above that 
door, barely made out in the crinkled steel, are the words, 
"Medical Bay."

A Ruined Waiting Room~
   This wing of the room lies in a mangled heap, with the walls 
cumpled and the roof half-collapsed. Underfoot is the hard rock 
of the moon, with an occasional jagged piece of metal strewn 
across it. Windows line the southern wall, but the glass has 
been shattered out of every one. A hole is ripped into the 
western wall, and to the east the ruins continue.

The Inside of a Crooked Shaft~
   This shaft is a vertical drop - save the places that 
structural damage has been and altered its shape - leading to the 
elevator below and the innards of the ship above. A series of 
cables that once controlled the raising and lowering of the 
elevator hang limply in the middle of the shaft, along with 
various other wires, cables, and pipes. 
   Stretching upwards vertically to the north side of the ladder 
is a giant word, written presumably in blood or red spraypaint:

A Frozen, Broken Shaft~
   This shaft stretches a ways up into the metallic inards of the ship, most of 
which spill out from various tears and cracks. Thick clustered of wires hang 
out from missing panels, pipes just through the steel, and everwhere there is a 
thick layer of frost - the majority of which is colored a mottle crimson. A 
thick elevator cable dangles limply, attached to nothing but the roof above. 
On the eastern wall is a rickety steel ladder, miraculously still intact. In 
the place of the floor are the jagged rocks of the moon, jutting this way and 
that.

Formerly, an Office~
   Perhaps the only thing that indicates that this small room 
might once have been an office is the metal desk that, somehow, 
still remains in the room, even though the floor beneath is long 
gone - it is as battered as the rest of the ship, half-buried 
into the western wall. The rest of this room is all but destroy; 
the roof is half-caved in, and the eastern wall has been ripped 
wide open.

   This room is an absolute mess; two holes lead into it, one 
ripped from the north and the west, each one flanked on all side 
by jagged shards of steel. This room is little more than a 
go-between - any usefulness that it ever saw was ripped away. To 
the north the ceiling is caved in, but it is possible to move 
onwards with crawling and a measure of squirming.

A Jagged Hallway, Blocked~
   The chaotic scene here spreads to the end of the hallway, 
unending, reaching down the entire hall's length. Scratches and 
dents dot the walls and doors alike, leaving no area unscathed; a 
tornado of random violence has torn through this small hallway, 
causing damage to even the most well-tempered factory steel. 
Northwards is a demolished blastdoor, leading immediately to a 
gigantic rock, and the roof has collapsed over the passage to the 
east, barring passage. Southwards stands a battered blastdoor, 
still somewhat serviceable.

An Utterly Destroyed Room~
   Whatever this room once was, it is not now - the metal that 
made it up in crumpled and bent and torn, givel it more of an 
oval shape than anything else. It is completely empty save the 
shards of metal that protrude from other pieces of metal. 
Eastwards, where once stood a door, stands nothing but empty 
space - it leads further down into the ruins of the ship. A tear 
rips through the western wall, large enough for a man to fit 
through, leading out to the moonscape. Also to note is the lack 
off floor - moonrocks lie underfoot.

A Semi-Spherical Room~
   This room was painted beige once - but that paint is mostly 
scratched off, with the little that remains hanging on in 
desperate clusters, scattered around the room. For the most 
part, this room is roughly spherical, with two exceptions. One 
is the large number of dents and dings in the metal, and the 
other is the fact that the entire floor and eastern wall have 
been ripped clean away, lost to whatever disaster might have 
befallen this place. Where the floor should be in the rough rock 
of the moon's surface, and eastwards leads onwards into another 
demolished room.

A Gray Exercise Room~
   This room is in a milder state of destruction - while few 
things have been broken, most have been looted. The room clearly 
once served as some sort of therapeutic exercise room, as can be 
attested by the walking bars in the center of the room, and 
various other therapedic equipment that is bolted to the floor 
and made of stronger materials. Anything useless and weak has 
been broken and left - this includes a row of no-longer plush 
couches, and a few shattered glass items. Besides the bolted, 
battered and broken items, this room is completely empty - 
testament to a raid of the medical wing.

lies an opening into a hallway. The opening is hinged, but the 
door is nowhere to be seen.

A Ruined ICU~
   This room was quite possibly an ICU, but serves now as nothing 
but a room filled with useless junk. The room is a whirlwind of 
destruction - every piece of medical equipment inside has been 
torn apart in some way and strewn across the ground. The result 
is an ankle-deep coating of sharp, metallic bits, threatening to 
cut any unarmored ankles. This room has not, however, been 
looted - a keen eye could make out pieces of useful items 
sticking up out of the debris. Otherwise, this room is useless, 
with the operating table and Dispens-A-Med ripped apart.

   This ICU has been kept in pretty good shape - the operating 
table stands stoically in the center, flanked on all sides by a 
slew of medical equipment and tools. The area seems fairly 
clean, unlike the rest of the med bay, as dust does not coat 
every surface - or any surface at all. The entire room is 
spick-and-span, seemingly ready for an operation to take place 
right this instant. A Dispens-A-Med sits cheerily on the 
aft-side wall, it's blue surface giving color to the otherwise 
dull room.

   The primary destroyer of this ICU is age. Yellowed papers 
line the walls, cracked x-rays dot the floors, and the recycled 
air is perhaps mustier in this room than in others. Dust coats 
the operating table and the medical equipment that surrounds it, 
the machinery in a state of long disuse. While not destroyed, 
the machinery still seems mostly unusable, though most likely 
able to be scrapped.

liberally, along with the tips of the tools. The sight is truly 
macabre, and continues to be so as the research lab stretches out 
to the aft of the ship. Scrawled out, hastily, in blood on the

   The rows of stained experimentation tables and tools continue 
all the way up until a few feet away from the aft wall. The wall 
is lined with desks, each one covered in yellowed diagrams, 
medical charts, and other such papers. These are also fitted 
tackily to the wall, giving this side of the labs an altogether 
untidy appearance. Fitted snugly into the starboard wall is a 
stark white, rounded steel door with a retinal scanner beside it. 
Upon the door is stencilled in red paint, "HC-0023." A small 
port-hole, coated in dust, sits about halfway up the single door. 
The stern side of the ship bears a set of double-blast doors 
painted in a fading red with various symbols that can only barely 
be made out from the peeling of molten metal that dashes the 
surface in fleck of silvery-black steel.

crooked pass with a remarkably intact access ladder allowing the only means of 
moving up and down through the cramped tunnel. The walls of the shaft itself

   This passageway dead ends here with a sliding double door set 
in the southern bulkhead, the clutter of the area making

and droop from the ceiling or jut dangerously upwards from 
beneath the floor as the panels once keeping them concealed are 
bent, broken, or missing entirely. A once pathway to the east

dust, and once melted - now frozen - rubber compact the narrow 
tunnel to block any hope of travel that direction.

an access panel on the north-side of the east tunnel, which has 
been fully blocked by metals and other refuse, preventing 
entrance to the crawl space. Nearly all of the floor panels on

precariously atop other loose panels, leaving ample fissures 
between and unknown perils in the darkness below.

A Narrow, Crumpled Passageway~
   This former intersection now offers only one route of travel, 
between north and south. The eastern tunnel extends for several 
meters before abruptly coming to a mountainous pile of metals 
ranging in size and shape from tiny scraps to massive sections of 
collapsed ceiling and mildly ragged to knife-point sharp. Near 
to where the two tunnels meet, part of floor is utterly 
collapsed, the pipes and wires below crushed into an effective 
sinkhole with a slender support beam the only means of crossing.

   Compared to adjoining tunnels, this room is in good shape. 
The space is large and pentagonal in shape, with a sliding door 
stuck half-way open to the south. The northern portion of the 
room is a plethora of rainbows as wires tangle with other wires 
in endless clumps and bundles, some still partially attached to 
the many panel-free bulkheads from where they were scavenged. 
Pipes crisscross overhead in a jumbled maze, a handful of them 
loose and threatening to fall while the majority remain firmly 
supported.

Port Laser Pod~
   On each side of the narrow passageway are sheets of

A Ruined, Charred Room~
   This large room is dominated by a block of equipment racks set 
back to back in several rows in the center, with barely room to 
pass between. Thick trunks of cables pass overhead, joining the 
rows together and disappearing into the deck. Around the 
perimeter of the compartment save the port bulkhead, more 
equipment racks are lined, each with several dead gray display 
panels and number keypads. There are three consoles in the room, 
with monitors and keyboards, the chairs overturned. The port 
bulkhead is completely covered by empty patch pannels, and a gray 
steel ladder can be slid along tracks to enable access to the 
highest jacks. Hundreds of patch cords of various lengths are 
tangled in a pile where the rack that held them has fallen.

the important signals. There should be patch panels in each 
section that would be labeled to give a clue. The entire wiring 
diagram would of course be available in the ship's computers. 
The switch itself is badly damaged, since damage anywhere in the 
ship would send surges to parts of the switch here and burn out 
the output amps.

   This relatively wide passage leads north to west. There's a 
bit of an alcove off to the west that was probably a passage at 
one point. Now, though, it's just a collapsed ruin that prevents 
travel in that direction. The rubberized mat that coats the 
floor is in rough shape and mostly frozen, anyway. The strip of 
partially glowing light on the west side of the corridor no 
longer exists, survived by its partner on the east side which has 
mostly given up the ghost.

hundred yards long and deep. A solid door is set into the 
western wall, bearing a wheel in the center that is used to open 
it. From the door, the hangar stretches upwards and outwards. 
Catwalks and beams crisscross the area, but have collapsed 
downward to the floor. Fractured steel cables and frayed rope 
spews from the rubble like strands of spaghetti, or intestines. 
Some of them are still attached to pulleys and complicated 
block-and-tackle systems. Many of the hoses bear the scorched 
signs of heat damage, and still others are frozen over entirely -

A Monstrous, Ghoulish Hangar~
   The hangar finally comes to an end here in a pair of utterly 
massive sliding doors. Powered wheels are set into the the gray 
of the stainless steel walls, with a mess of broken rods and cogs 
and hydraulics attaching them to the doors. The rest of the 
hangar is fulled of over-turned, scattered loading equipment - 
cranes and pulleys, carts and trolleys. The air is thick with 
steel cables and pulley blocks, while catwalks have collapsed 
from overhead to create obstacles in moving about. 
   While massive, the hangar shows no signs of functionality - 
all of the mechanics are dead and quiet. Life exists here, 
though, in the form of an uncountable number of cocoons and silky 
nests, alien goo and eggs. This foreign stronghold has overtaken 
the ex-Hangar, and slimey remnants of a strange brood of creature 
line the walls, hang from the ceilings and fill the floors. It 
is almost impossible to walk here without stepping on some alien 
substance, and every indication shows that this nest is quite 
active and flourishing.

glass booth. The waiting room is without chairs or tables, and 
is utterly empty save for a speakerbox and attached microphone 
built into one wall by the door. The section of room beyond that 
transparent glass border begs more consideration: several heavy 
cabinets are bolted to the bulkheads directly behind a counter 
set flush against the glass wall, each keyed to a retinal scanner 
and keypad nearby. There are two chairs on either side of this

crumpled and the floor set into a rippling wave. A couple of 
bits of metal are wedged into the eastern bulkhead. One looks 
like it may have once been a chair with a little bit of padding 
still clinging to it. There's a mostly functional door on the 
east side of the room while to the north there is a raised 
platform.

A Demolished, Half-Collapsed Bridge~
   The crash has left this room a wreck. Whatever shape it once 
was, it is now a crumpled mass of sheet metal and high tech 
alloys with shattered and ruined electronics scattered about. 
The mangled bulkheads twist and turn, buckled in some places and 
sheared off in others. The deck itself has writhed in some sort 
of metallic stress event, leaving it as warped as the walls. 
Various bits debris litters the deck in the form of uprooted 
chairs and consoles which have mutually destroyed each other. 
The room is carpeted, but the carpet is soaked with frozen blood 
which have caused most of the smaller debris to be, more or less, 
glued down into place. The bodies that leaked so much of their 
vital fluids are no where to be seen.

A Red-Lined Hallway~
   The walls of this hallway are the same uniform gray that

in all visible directions. Upon the floor is painted a single 
red line, running straight along the length of the hallway. 
Inside the line, the word "EMERGENCY" is stenciled in stark white

it widens into a room. The floor of this hallway is nonexistant, 
and jagged rock pokes up, mangling the walls. As the hallways

A Long, Askew Hallway~
   Twisted, broken steel makes up the length of this hallway. 
The metal has been warped from structural damage into a bend, 
tilting path - often, if one were to walk in a straight line, 
they would be walking on a wall or nothing; at places the floor 
has just been altogether ripped away from the wall. The view 
these holes provide are full of the mangled mess of floors below, 
disappearing into the bowels of the ship. Footing is perilous at 
best, and nearly impossible at worst. Various debris collects in 
pits that the floor creates - these are mostly jagged pieces of

in a hallway that is no longer big enough to support it.

A Smaller Room Lined by Metal Lockers~
   Branching off from the larger barracks, this room feels almost 
cozy by comparison. Every wall has been lined by tall lockers, 
and benches take up the center of the room. Various posters have 
been tacked to the walls, or even to the fronts of lockers, 
detailing various protocol: how to properly fit a spacesuit, how 
to iron clothing, how to maintain boots, how to make a bed, what 
is considered contraband, etc.

below it. This poster informs the reader about proper ironing 
protocol in tiny, hard-to-read font: 
#0
 #2Start the process by ironing the collar.#0 Stretch the back of 
it across the flat surface of the board. Run the iron over the 
back of the collar several times until you are sure it is 
correctly pressed. Turn the shirt over and handle the front of 
the collar.
#0
 #2Move to the sleeves of the garment.#0 You need to be sure to 
iron the back of the sleeves first, then move to the front of 
the sleeves. Start by stretching the larger part of the sleeves 
across the point of the ironing board. Iron all the way around 
the back of the sleeves, then move it toward the sleeve front 
until you have ironed the circumference of the sleeve. Stretch 
the lower back of the sleeve across the large, flat surface of 
the ironing board. Iron toward the cuffs. #2Flip the shirt over 
and do the front, making sure to take careful, short strokes.#0 
#0
 #2Hang the shirt directly after you finish ironing.#0 Be sure 
to button the top and center buttons.
#0
 #2Turn the pants inside out. Begin with the top.#0 Iron the 
circumference of the waistband. Move toward the pockets. Be 
sure to iron both sides of the pockets. Iron the fly, then 
the seams of the pants, then the hems. Follow that order 
carefully, and use smooth, quick strokes.
#0
 #2Turn the pants so the correct side is facing out.#0 Hook the 
waistline of the pants around the arrow shaped edge of the 
board. Use the iron to press out the wrinkles of the top front 
part of your pants.
#0
 Put the pants legs parallel to the board, with both of them 
headed in the same direction. #2Iron each leg without damaging 
the current creases.#0
#0
  Iron the cuffs, and #2hang the pants.#0

The Monochromatic, Tiled Shower Room~
   This shower room offers no privacy at all - it is a single, 
open room with a tiled floor sloping gradually towards a metal 
mesh grate at its center. A series of showerheads, built into 
the ceiling, spray lukewarm water down directly on three by three 
foot pressure plates as soon as they are triggered, and cease 
once the weight has been removed from the plate. There are 
easily over thirty such plates, covered by rubber mats, and 
showerheads, scattered throughout the room.

A Warped, Broken Messhall~
   This old messhall is a whirlwind of destruction - tables have 
been forcibly ripped from the floor and strewn about, and not a 
single one retains its previous table shape; they are hunks of 
faceless steel, balled up in corners. Unidentifiable chunks of 
frozen red ice litter the ground as well in various sizes that 
are strewn all over. If one were to find a chunk large enough 
and take a really good look, however, they would notice that 
these are human bodyparts - a finger here, an eyeball there, and 
also ears. 
   Blocky letters adorn the starboard wall above the doors, 
written very neatly in red. The message says, simply, "#1God is

that slides toward the large, broken window to the west, and its 
walls are made from a form of composite material, once stained to 
resemble wood. Now, however, it just looks gaudy and cheap. Its 
ceiling is high and peaked. 
   To the west, a long window - some eight feet high and thirteen 
feet wide - gapes in the wall of the ship, shattered and 
completely blown out.

This banner has been bolted to the wall it hangs from and, though faded, 
seems to be in good repair. On it, a flaming phoenix perches, wrapping its 
fiery wings around a gray sphere. It would be impossible to remove this 
banner without tearing it in two, or three, separate pieces.

A Cramped, Lopsided Bathroom~
   The white tiles of this bathroom floor are all cracked and 
shattered, revealing metal floor beneath. The ivory plaster on 
the walls and ceiling has chipped away, and a broken toilet lies 
against the western wall, burst piping twisting away from it like 
flash frozen intestines. A raised platform by one wall marks 
where a shower once stood; the showerhead is gone.

The Walk-In Freezer~
   Colder than any freezer was ever meant to be, this cramped 
space is little more than layered ice. Ice juts from the walls, 
ceiling, and floor, where presumably shards of ice hit, stuck, 
and refroze. This gives the freezer the feel of an ancient 
torturing device, all spikes and sharp edges.

A Warped, Broken Messhall~
   This old messhall is a whirlwind of destruction - tables have 
been forcibly ripped from the floor and strewn about, and not a 
single one retains its previous table shape; they are hunks of 
faceless steel, balled up in corners. Unidentifiable chunks of 
frozen red ice litter the ground as well in various sizes that 
are strewn all over. If one were to find a chunk large enough 
and take a really good look, however, they would notice that 
these are human bodyparts - a finger here, an eyeball there, and 
also ears.

A Cramped, Crumpled Room~
   A toilet sits against one sleek, metal wall, and built into 
the ceiling is a showerhead. Two handles, one marked H and one 
marked C, sit set in the wall below it. The tiled floor slopes 
gradually towards a tiny mesh grate beneath the showerhead. 
Clogged with clotted, dried blood, bits of sloughed flesh and 
hair, the mesh grate currently sits under a sheet of milky, 
reddish colored ice. 
   Upon the starboard wall a hasty message is scrawled upon the 
tile. The letters are blocky, scratchy, and done in a vague 
substance, crimson in color. It reads: "#1AND DEATH! O, DEATH 
WALKS THESE HALLS!#0"

harsh impersonality of the rest of the deck is lost here - the

Sharp Turn in the Askew Hallway~
   The lopsided hallway comes to a halt and splits off in either 
direction, to the north and to the south. Ancient pieces of 
debris litter the warped steel floor - bits of jagged metal and 
frozen trash, and every now and then what could possibly be a 
shard of bone, worn to the same dull gray as the battered steel 
walls.

Outside the Ship, by a Jagged Breach in Hull~
   It would be easy to say that space is cold, mind-numbingly, 
icy cold - and dark. It is cold and it is dark. It is 
absolutely frigid. Chunks of debris, pieces of hull, even the 
jagged breach itself - these are also cold, achingly cold. But 
they would not feel cold if touched, and anyone in space would 
not feel that deep, bone-shattering freeze. Anyone in a 
pressurized spacesuit would not feel the chill at all, and anyone 
not so dressed would have more pressing issues at hand: the water 
on their skin would evaporate first, their eyes would shrivel, 
and they would prune like a raisin left too long in the sun. 
Ninety seconds without oxygen and their lungs would shred. With 
oxygen, unsuited, it's a slow death: blood loss and organ 
failure. 
  Still, the view is nice.

A Grate Opens into a Buckling Vent~
   This ventilation shaft allows air to pass and filter through 
the various decks of the ship. The shaft is rather large for a 
vent - it does not quite allow an average-ized person to stand

movement. Moving through this thin metal vent is exceptionally 
noisy and seems fairly dangerous - the risk of falling through 
the bottom into whatever lies below is ever present, as is the

A Crinkled Air Vent~
   This ventilation shaft allows air to pass and filter through 
the various decks of the ship. The shaft is rather large for a 
vent - it does not quite allow an average-sized person to stand 
completely upright, but it does offer a fairly large range of 
movement. Moving through this thin metal vent is exceptionally 
noisy, but appears generally safe - the vents are attached 
tightly, and give very little against weight pressed against it.

A Crinkled Air Vent~
   This ventilation shaft allows air to pass and filter through 
the various decks of the ship. The shaft is rather large for a 
vent - it does not quite allow an average-ized person to stand 
completely upright, but it does offer a fairly large range of 
movement. Moving through this thin metal vent is exceptionally 
noisy and seems fairly dangerous - the risk of falling through 
the bottom into whatever lies below is ever present, as is the 
darkness that crowds the duct.

A Ruined Cryogenics Chamber~
   Dull bluish white lights flicker and buzz in this massive, 
lifeless chamber. The floor is a black, painted metal equipped 
with countless little bumps to increase friction. About two 
dozen feet above looms the ceiling, only one of its large 
rectangular lights still shining pale and bright every few 
seconds. Cold gray metal makes up the walls between the pods, 
smudged, dirty from lack of care. The walls and pods are only 
interrupted once in the aft section of the room, where a large 
rectangular window provides a view into the moonscape beyond.

The lights, walls and floor are all professionally, featurelessly 
white. The steel cabinets and tables are undecorated, yet free

them has been bolted securely to the floor, a permanent part of 
the clinic. Everything else, however, has been stripped clear of

A Burnt-Out Panic Room~
   This vast, hexagonal room has been ravaged by fire or some 
type of explosion - most of the metal is scorched black, and 
piles of ashes cover the steel floor. Various electronic 
equipment sits dead and charred, burned beyond recognition. 
Metal frames that were once pieces of furniture are scattered 
haphazardly around. A sigil once painted the floor, but now it 
is mostly covered in ash and soot - what looks like flames and a 
quarter of a sphere can be seen, and beneath a bunch of smudges 
can be made out the words, #1"S... Pho...x"#0. 
   The doors around have mostly been melted shut, or the 
mechanisms to open them have been ruined. A series of blackened 
steps lead to a hatch.

Each hallway, however, is nearly identical to the other: heavy, 
metal squares with a raised, herringbone pattern, painted gray, 
make up the floor. The bulkheads and overhead are a featureless, 
sterile white. There is little debris, and almost no clutter.

The Hallway Outside of an Elevator~
   The cold metal hallway continues featurelessly here, broken 
only by a pair of elevator doors on the eastern end. Trailing 
down these doors, starting at middle height, are a few winding 
red stains in a streamlike pattern. Obviously having been buffed 
and cleaned, the stains on the door are visible only when 
inspected deliberately. The halls themselves have been cleaned 
and maintained along the bottom, though dust has gathered 
noticeably above arm's reach.

A Fork in the Hallway~
   The lighting flows into this room and branches off in two 
directions, leading to tall metal doors on either side. Slightly 
wider than the hallway that leads into it, this area has been 
kept relatively clean and polished. An image of a running man 
has been painted in white above the southern door. Likewise, the 
simple figure of a straight-postured man has been painted in 
white above the east door and an equally simple image of a woman 
in a skirt above the door to the western side.

A Quaint, Looted Bar and Grill~
   Cracked, peeling and even mismatched, the drab-colored paints 
on the walls of this room give off a dreary aura. On the floor 
is a series of maroon and mustard-colored tiles in a checkered 
pattern. The walls appear to be made of stone, but chips from 
some kind of bludgeoning reveal it to be a gritty gray-brown 
powder. On the eastern end of the room lies a large canvas, 
which was clearly once a background for a video projection. Now 
it is ripped nearly in half at an awkward angle and hangs 
uselessly above the floor.

A Torn-Open Blast-Door Leading To a Ramp~
A droning buzz radiates from the sporadically blinking lights 
mounted overhead in this narrow tube-tunnel. The entire space is 
an endless sea of grays and whites, broken only by the lurking 
shadows which bend around the embossed metal supports flanking 
the hallway. The square-paneled flooring underfoot begins a 
steep descent at the far end before abruptly meeting a thick 
blast door. To the west lies the bulkhead of the wrecked ship, 
thick blast doors once in place here now rendered into ribbons of 
thick steel, beaten open and torn to strips from this side and 
pushed outward. Beyond the doors lies the bright, sunlit 
stainless steel ramp.

scanner hangs on the bulkhead next to the western door, which is 
stained with dried blood. Dark stains cover the entirety of this 
area - the floor, the walls, the ceiling. Some of the stains are 
black and some are crimson, and they stretch from just outside 
the western door and a ways to the north, blotting out the 
otherwise monotonous gray.

A Large Ballroom and Commons~
   The doorway here opens to a set of alabaster half-circle 
stairs which descend into the commons. A rich deep blue carpet 
reaches every corner of this large room. Woven over the majority 
of it is the strikingly bright image of a fiery bird of prey, its 
wings protectively encircling a gray sphere. The metal walls are 
entirely covered by dark panels, which frame a massive, cracked 
window that makes up the entire wall to the fore of the room, 
providing a fractured view of the moonscape beyond. Several 
glass chandeliers lie on the blue carpet, shattered, with glass 
spilling across the vivid blue. On the southern side, two sets 
of carpeted, blue stairs wind fifteen feet up to an expansive 
stage, which overlooks the entire room. Just above this, a large 
section of ceiling has been shredded and opened up to a dark room 
above. The opening appears unnatural, as though the metal was 
pushed upward from below, and not forced downward from above.

A Bend in the Shadowy Hallway~
   This darkening hallway turns, growing progressively darker to 
the west, while a single light flickers inconstantly down the 
portside twist of hallway. The floor of the hallway is gray, 
tiled, and layered thinly by dust. The walls are smooth, white, 
but mottled in places by darker stains, or off-white spots. 
Though there are light fixtures overhead, they appear inoperable.

A Stretch of Dimly-Lit Hallway~
   This stretch of tiled, sterile hallway has taken a turn for 
the decidedly unsettling. A faded, yellowy-brown smear mars the 
whiteness of the walls and, though the gray floor tiles are 
undamaged, there are scuff marks on their surface, mingled with 
dust, and the pristine bulkheads above appear menacing in the 
inconstant lighting. A single, dim overhead light flickers 
uncertainly, as often off as it is on.

far south, but does not hinder visibility.

   This darkened corner of the walkway twists sharply at an 
elbow-junction, a solitary door present at the outer curve of the 
turning point. Black, slat-paneled metal flooring breaks the 
otherwise cylindrical passageway, the small remainder of the 
curved design visible through the gaps underfoot. White walls 
fitted with gray supports complete the monotonous theme. While 
lighting fixtures are present overhead, they appear to be

A Blue Gym with Padded Floors~
   This room is entirely surrounded by royal blue-painted steel 
walls. The floor is a grid of one-inch-wide, dark wooden panels 
framing a series of coarse woven pads of a beige material. The 
pads themselves are rectangular and large enough to engulf the 
average man laying down. Every feature of this room has a look 
of wear and tear about it, though it appears fully able to serve

Inside a Large Air Vent, Beneath a Transparent Door~
   This ventilation shaft allows air to pass and filter through 
the various decks of the ship. The shaft is rather large for a 
vent - it does not quite allow an average-ized person to stand 
completely upright, but it does offer a fairly large range of 
movement. Moving through this thin metal vent is exceptionally 
noisy and seems fairly dangerous - the risk of falling through 
the bottom into whatever lies below is ever present, as is the 
darkness that crowds the duct.

On the right-hand side of the northern door is set the elevator

A Tidy Greeting Room~
   The ship widens up into a sizable greeting room, with a large 
sign hanging from the roof decorated in bright, happy colors; the 
sign reads "Welcome to Level Two, Rest and Recreation!" A counter 
sits off near the western corner, labeled "Towel retrieval" on 
one end and "Towel return" on the other. Hallways split down the 
west and east of the ship, their metallic walls cutting deep. 
The northern doors are made of a thick glass, offering a clear 
view of the area beyond. A sign is affixed to the wall above the 
northern doors.

   This long hallway runs from east to west through this deck of 
the ship. It is relatively wide and its walls are a pleasant, 
neutral white in color, though are cold to the touch and feel 
vaguely metallic. The floor is equally cold to the touch, and 
composed of that same metallic material, but has been painted a 
deeper cream color, speckled here and there with touches of a 
deep, homely brown.

Inside a Large Air Vent~
   This ventilation shaft allows air to pass and filter through 
the various decks of the ship and, though large for a vent, is 
nontheless a cramped and small space - even the smallest person 
would find travelling through this narrow maze difficult. Moving 
through this thin metal vent is exceptionally noisy and seems 
fairly dangerous - the risk of falling through the bottom into 
whatever lies below is ever present, as is the darkness that 
crowds the duct.

This is a metal grate. It has a latch holding it shut, and it
presumably keeps either idiots out of the ventilation system,

Private Quarters~
   These private quarters are roomy enough, though give the air 
of being cramped. Three-fourths of the way into the room is a 
solid sheet of sliding, polarized glass, seperating the room from 
a tidy bathroom area - containing a toilet, a small sink, a 
smaller mirror, and a cramped shower. While not particularly 
dusty, the room has obviously not been inhabited for quite some 
time.

Underwater~
   This swimming pool is fairly long and deep enough to be 
hazardous to anyone unable to swim. The water is cool, but not 
chilly, and murky. The brackish water is solid black in color. 
The bottom of the pool is rough to the touch and tiled on it is 
the insignia of the phoenix, its wings encircling a gray sphere. 
   Pipes lead out of the northern wall and disappear into the 
floor by a drain. A grate has been set in the wall by the pipes, 
and appears as if it might easily be removed.

   The walls are lined by pipes, adding to the claustrophobic

Rather cramped, this tunnel seems to have only been made to one

be a very bad idea - it has been completely flooded. The water

An Elevator~
   The inside of the elevator is clean, military, uniform, and 
(above all) silent. Kept lit by a single burning flourescent 
light, the cramped and blank interior is plain for all to see. 
On the right-hand side of the starboard door is set the elevator 
buttons, glowing a dim red and displaying numbers for Levels One 
through Five. A bright red alarm button is set beneath the 
number-buttons, and a tiny warning label can be seen beneath 
that.

   This stretch of hallway has been marked only by a long, 
straight slash. Beginning at about shoulder-height and trailing 
smoothly to the floor, this scar is set nearly an inch deep 
within the metal wall. Off in the distance, to the south, a door 
with a white-painted image of a running man above it is visible. 
In the north direction an intersection of corridors can be seen.

The Men's Restroom~
   The flooring of this room consists of several small white 
tiles, which go on to make up the walls. To the left of the 
entrance are three bathroom stalls, painted gray and appearing 
neglected. To the immediate right are two urinals, seperated by 
short gray walls. Beyond that is a bar with two sinks and two 
small mirrors, made of a blue plastic that resembles a marble 
pattern. At the back of the room are four individual shower 
stalls, which each consist of a curtain, two walls and a faucet. 
Immediately outside of them is a small changing stall, made of 
the same gray fiber material as the bathroom stalls. On the 
opposite wall is an indent and a bathtub. The floors and walls 
have been stained with mold and rust in some places, but 
altogether the room is kept in good order.

airy hue. The floorboards are painted sky blue and the walls, 
covered with a hardened powdery material, have been coated in 
pure white paint and appear to be maintained well. Royal blue 
dominates the metal ceiling, white lights within shining down on 
the room below. The composite doorframes for each exit match the 
floorboards in color and design.

   Small white tiles coat the floor of this room. As one enters, 
a row of four sinks sits off to the right, overlooked by a long 
mirror. On the left are three bathroom stalls, which have been 
painted a maroon color. The walls consist of smaller cream 
colored tiles, a few of them chipped. At the back of the room, 
and to the left, four individual shower stalls are aligned, each 
one enclosed by three walls and a curtain. Outside the shower 
stalls are small changing rooms, made of the same composite 
plastic material as the bathroom stalls, also maroon. Opposite 
the shower stalls is an indent with a bathtub, a curtain hanging 
before it. The lighting is built into the ceiling, revealing the 
room to be worn but well-maintained.

The Beginning of a Door-Flanked Hallway~
   A small, flat little bar is set on the floor in the doorway 
here, dividing this room from a stretch of hallway. On one side 
of the bar, hard lavender plastic tile glistens dully. On the 
other, in the hallway, the floor is covered by a rich, maroon 
colored carpet. The walls have been painted a deep tan color, 
interrupted on both sides only by doors. Doorframes loom, made 
of the same darkened faux-oak material as the doors they 
surround, composite, brittle but strong. The corridor itself 
seems to have been fairly well cared for, though nicks in the 
walls tell a different story.

The End of a Door-Flanked Hallway~
   As the hallway comes to an abrupt stop, the most obvious 
adornment of the port-side wall is a single, small, perfectly 
circular hole. It leaves the metal visible behind the powdery 
substance which covers the wall. Painted a dark tan color and 
occasionally nicked, the walls here stand firm. The maroon 
carpet here is well worn but clean; each of the three doors is 
made of solid stained faux-oak composite.

The Middle of a Door-Flanked Hallway~
   The maroon colored carpet continues resolutely down the 
hallway, flanked by dark tan-colored walls and stained faux-oak 
composite doors. Next to the aft door, the tan-colored powdery 
substance gives way to indented metal. The forward door, too, 
has been damaged. On the bottom of the door, the lower end has 
been destroyed and splintered, leaving the bottom three inches 
repaired sloppily by gray duct tape.

The Beginning of a Door-Lined Hallway~
   The beige-brown plastic tiles continue straight down this 
corridor. Both walls are flanked by dark, stained composite 
doors with matching, plastic doorframes. Thin metal bars line 
the corners where the floors meet the walls. Undecorated and 
featureless, the walls are made of deep gray metal.

The Middle of a Door-Lined Hallway~
   Continuing down the hallway, the beige plastic tiles begin to 
appear abused. Just before the aft door all of the tiles have 
been ripped up, revealing the stained and grimy metal beneath. 
The walls of the corridor are plain and unpolished. Both 
directions lead to an area with three doors.

The End of a Door-Lined Hallway~
   The passage ends abruptly here, a door on every wall. Only a 
few of the beige tiles remain intact here, replaced only with 
grimy metal which is sticky to the touch. On the port wall, the 
door has no knob or latch. Duct tape has been smoothed over the 
fist-sized damage zone.

Entrance to a Public Natatorium~
   This large, open room appears to have only one entrance to the 
southern side through a blastdoor, each half of it made from a 
thick, reinforced glass. A narrow swimming pool takes up much of 
the middle of this room with ladders leading into and out of it. 
The deck itself has been made out of some composite material that 
prevents slipping, and several tables have been bolted to the 
floor. The chairs, curiously, appear to have been removed. A 
shower room branches off to the west.

A Turn in the Hallway~
   This hallway runs north to south through this deck on the ship 
and connects here with another, similar hallway that runs fore to 
aft. It is relatively wide and its walls are a pleasant, neutral 
white in color, though are cold to the touch and feel vaguely 
metallic. The floor is equally cold to the touch, and composed 
of that same metallic material, but has been painted a deeper 
cream color, speckled here and there with touches of a deep, 
homely brown.

   These private quarters are roomy enough, though give the air 
of being cramped. Three-fourths of the way into the room is a 
solid sheet of sliding, polarized glass, seperating the room from 
a tidy bathroom area - containing a toilet, a small sink, a 
smaller mirror, and a cramped shower. While not particularly

   These stairs proceed upwards unmolested for roughly five 
steps. After that is a climbing stairwell littered by broken 
pipes, I-beams, glass shards and other debris, rendering passage 
impossible. Upon the wall, where "Level 2" perhaps should be 
stenciled, is instead a message: #1"Abandon all..."#0 can just be

allowing people to climb in and out of the water with ease.

A Public Natatorium~
   This large, open room appears to have only one entrance to the 
southern side through a blastdoor, each half of it made from a 
thick, reinforced glass. A narrow swimming pool takes up much of 
the middle of this room with ladders leading into and out of it. 
The deck itself has been made out of some composite material that 
prevents slipping, and several tables have been bolted to the 
floor. The chairs, curiously, appear to have been removed. A 
shower room branches off to the west.

A Swimming Pool~
   This swimming pool is fairly long and deep enough to be 
hazardous to anyone unable to swim. The water is cool, but not 
chilly, and murky. The brackish water is solid black in color, 
and smells of death. A few ladders line the sides of the pool, 
allowing people to climb in and out of the water with ease.

room, and a filtration sytem - a writhing mass of plastic and 
metal tubing - continuously pumps water through the tank and into 
the floor by way of the many larger pipes in the room, lining the 
walls and ceiling. The floor is rough and rubbery, allowing some 
grip, and there is a single exit to the east. A grate leads down 
to a small utility tunnel, flanked by more piping.

   These private quarters are roomy enough, though give the air

a tidy bathroom area - containing a toilet, a small sink, a

Inside a Large Air Vent~
   This ventilation shaft allows air to pass and filter through 
the various decks of the ship and, though large for a vent, is 
nontheless a cramped and small space - even the smallest person 
would find travelling through this narrow maze difficult. Moving 
through this thin metal vent is exceptionally noisy and seems 
fairly dangerous - the risk of falling through the bottom into 
whatever lies below is ever present, as is the darkness that 
crowds the duct.

   The walls are lined by pipes, adding to the claustrophobic 
feel of this utility tunnel, and there is a low ceiling overhead. 
Rather cramped, this tunnel seems to have only been made to one 
purpose - to move through it to the other side, and to not 
linger. Lingering, in any case, in this part of the tunnel would 
be a very bad idea - it has been completely flooded. The water 
is murky and would have a slightly chlorinated taste if 
swallowed.

some small amount of privacy, and each one is equipped with a

A Short, Lopsided Hallway~
   The ceiling in this section of hallway has partially collapsed 
on one side, lending to a crooked feeling. A manageable path can 
be found through the rubble as pipes and wires hover loosely 
overhead, most of their supports visibly missing or damaged. The 
floor panels, although littered with debris, are mostly intact. 
The walkway continues east and west.

A Hallway, Collapsing to the East~
   This short hallway leads from west to east, slate herringboned 
gray floors cutting through the ship's interior. All manner of 
pipes and wire bundles run along the ceiling, appearing as 
exposed innards, hanging low. To the east, a wider passageway is 
visible, darker and daunting - but so debris-choked as to be 
virtually impassable. The northern wall of this passageway is 
bowed outward, gouged.

A Tilted Vent~
   This ventilation shaft allows air to pass and filter through 
the various decks of the ship and, though large for a vent, is 
nontheless a cramped and small space - even the smallest person 
would find travelling through this narrow maze difficult. Moving 
through this thin metal vent is exceptionally noisy and seems 
fairly dangerous - the risk of falling through the bottom into 
whatever lies below is ever present, as is the darkness that 
crowds the duct. The vent tilts upwards dramatically, to the 
port, proving to be all but climbable.

End of the Elevator Shaft~
   This square, vertical shaft penetrates the ship's vitals. A series of thick 
cables disappear into the darkness both above and below, and though it might be 
possible to climb down from here by way of the cables, further progress upwards 
is immediately blocked by a sealed, horizontal blastdoor. The cables disappear 
into it, presumably still travelling upwards out the other end, and on the 
inoperable door are the words: #6Deck Six#0. 
   Stretching upwards vertically to the starboard side of the ladder is a giant 
word, written presumably in blood or red spraypaint: #1"CONVERGE"#0.

A Hallway Turning Towards a Sealed Stairway~
   This smaller hallway branches off the long, spine-like hallway 
to the south, and is fairly cramped and narrow. The walls, floor 
and ceiling are all identical, sleek, metallic, and warped with 
structural damage. On the wall bordering the east, there is a 
large arrow, pointing to the north and at a sealed blastdoor. 
The blastdoor has been labeled: #6Stairs.#0 As with the rest of 
this floor, the area is warped from heavy structural damage, 
causing the floor to sit at an odd angle. Otherwise, though, it 
is fairly undamaged.

numbingly cold here and strange gas fogs the stale air. Tubes 
jut out of the walls, some hanging limply and some broken 
all-together. The floor and walls of the room are shaped from 
some sort of metal-plastic alloy. At the front of the chamber is 
a glass hatch with a number inscribed upon its sleek surface.

equipped with countless little friction-increasing bumps makes up

white lights drown out the myriad of different shining items. 
The walls consist of cold gray metal, polished and buffed. The 
scent of chemicals is powerful near the pods, which line the 
walls entirely except where a large rectangular window on the aft 
section provides a view into the space beyond.

A Large, Abandoned Storage Room~
   The most immediately noticeable feature of this large storage 
room is that almost half of its floor has collapsed on the 
southern section. Jagged scraps of metal reach up like bony 
claws from the ruin, making climbing up or down particularly 
difficult. The walls are thick and sturdy, as is the ceiling, 
and there is nothing of note in decor. There is a single door in 
the room on the starboard side. Painted hastily over its thick 
metal in red is the word #1"Quarantine"#0. Below, an expansive 
ballroom is visible through the gaping wound in the floor. The 
floor-lamps that once served to provide light to this place 
appear to have been violently torn out and smashed; broken wires 
hang limply from the lamp's corpses.

The Portside Locker Room~
   This locker room splays out from the entrance in a neat, 
militaristic square; a spartan square, with no space wasted. 
Rows of lockers line the walls and aluminum benches are bolted to 
the floor in the middle, spaced evenly to allow the ease of 
moving traffic. Every surface is the dull color of stainless 
steel - the room is strictly utilitarian and nothing else.

An Exposed Hole Between a Series of Pipes~

A Tiny, Cramped Maintainence Hatch~
   This appears to be a small maintainence hatch, the walls 
stripped clean of whatever was holding them before, with several 
jagged edges and holes dotting the walls. On the back side, 
another hole has been cut, barely big enough to fit even a small 
person.

Not even enough room to turn around, even the smallest of

dead ending into a smaller box that houses two vents, one

A Dimly Lit Room Filled with Research Equipment and Lab Benches~
   The middle of this room is dominated by a long bench that has 
small pockets in the countertop where stools sit amongst 
silvery-panelled chemical and supply cabinets. Dangling 
precariously over the lab bench is a single metal cable with 
various tiny but powerful lights that shed strategically placed 
light on various locations in the room. Many of the lights, 
however, appear to have been smashed or cannibalized, leaving the 
room lit at a pupil-dilating minimum. Lining the outer edges of 
the room are rows of intricately designed devices and research 
equipment, many of which seem to bear characteristically rounded 
edges as the only artistic addition to their otherwise 
utilitarian designs. Near the back of the room, a small sink 
protrudes from the wall awkwardly beside the stilted bar and 
rusting nozzle that form what must be a chemical shower.

The Room Behind the Hatch~
   A neat, railed stairway leads down the foreward wall of this 
large room. A large, bright touch-screen is set into the 
port-side wall, taking up the entire wall - with mutiple notes 
hastily jotted down upon its surface. Starting a few feet away 
from the screen are several rows of tiered benches, running up 
and back into the starboard wall. Otherwise, this room is 
composed of featureless, rivetted steel.

A Thin Space in the Walls of the Ship, Between Bulkheads~
   This thin space between the walls of the ship is barely five 
metres wide and littered with overhanging tubing and electrical 
components. The occasional vertical beam protrudes through the 
floor, giving the space the appearance of a metallic forest as it 
narrows into point near the stern of the ship. The only lighting 
in this room comes from a dangling electrical wire dangling far 
overhead that sprays a near-constant jet of sparks.

At the Top of a Hydraulics Shaft~
   The panel set into the fore of this tube opens up to a 
straight vertical drop, shrouded in darkness, with no way to know 
just how far the fall is. The tube is rivetted steel, and wide 
enough around to allow a group of pair size easy passage - 
straight down. Along the port-hand side of this shaft is a large 
system of supporting rods that form a cage around a section of a 
gigantic mechanized arm, coated in white plastic, the monstrosity 
continuing further down the shaft. 
   Scrawled halfway across the wall in crooked letters, 
impossibly large, is the single word "#1FROM#0," done in a vague 
crimson.

Half-Way Down a Hydraulics Shaft~
   This large cylinder continues down into the darkness, 
stainless, rivetted steel disappearing down below. The diameter 
of the tube is large enough to allow a fairly large group easy 
passage. The walls are blank and featureless, providing no hand- 
or foot-holds, and no way to leave. The tube narrows 
significantly - a flat surface that runs all the way around the 
diameter shaves off about a fourth of the available room. 
Nevertheless, it is still wide enough to provice easy passage. 
Where the tube narrows, the enormous mechanical arm disappears, 
lost behind several feet of stainless steel. 
   Writ across the wall in impossibly large letters is a sole 
word. "#1YOU#0," it reads, done in a hasty, crimson scrawl.

stainless, rivetted steel disappearing down below. While not 
quite as wide as he tube above, there is still ample room for a 
group of people to plummet side-by-side to the waiting darkness 
below. 
   The wall bears markings, a message written in impossibly-large 
letters, taking up nearly half the surface of the cyclinder. The 
sole word is, "#1IT#0."

Deep in a Hydraulics Shaft~
   This large cylinder continues down into the darkness, 
stainless, rivetted steel disappearing down below. It widens by 
about a fourth along the ways, and the mechanical arm slides back 
into view as the extra steel disappears, as large as a God, 
surrounded by a cage of support rods. The rest of the tube leads 
ever onwards, down into blackness. 
   Upon the starboard wall has been written a word - a single 
word, scrawled in a fading crimson and impossibly large letters. 
Taking up a full three-fourths of the available surface area, 
stopping just short of the robotic arm on both sides, the word 
"#1DEVOURS#0" is scrawled with semi-care, though the last letter 
is half-finished and drooping.

The Bottom of a Hydraulics Shaft~
   The cylinder, at long last, comes to a halt here. The walls 
eventually find the floor, one solid, featureless piece of steel, 
covered in grime and hydraulic fluid. Support rods continue to 
cage the massive mechanical arm until it drops out of sight, 
leading ever downwards. The walls here are as featureless as the 
floor as the cylinder just - ends.

   White. Above, below, ahead, behind. And nothing else. It 
stretches on into infinity, while also, seemingly, forming walls 
that block passage to particular locations. Completely blank and 
featureless, this whiteness is everything and nothing - vast,

A Collapse of Advanced Technology~
   This large room is a cacophany of chaos. A large hole punches 
through the middle of the floor, through which a mangled lift 
dangles, swinging limply on the few cables that still connect it 
to this floor. The white paint of the room is splotched with a 
dark red frost. On the ceiling there is a painting: a fiery 
bird-of-prey with its wings enclosed around a gray sphere. The 
picture is splotched with red frost, frozen in a splatter-pattern 
across that sphere.

A Cramped Corridor Before a Sealed Blastdoor~
   The corridor here is half-painted a stark white, leaving 
unfinished bits to taper off with a metallic gray as it splits 
east and west. The ceiling here is low - very low; it curves 
downward, as though warped from above, and allows only room for 
four feet between it and the floor. On the south end of the 
hall, the twisted shape of a blastdoor bends away from the wall. 
The weight of the collapsing ceiling above has altered its 
natural shape; the sprawling image of a fiery bird of prey 
wrapping its wings around a gray sphere was once painted in its 
center. Now, the warped metal is rent open in the middle, and 
the Phoenix is an eerie, mutated version of what it once was - 
covered in a thick layer of dusty permafrost.

A Semi-Comfortable Lounge~
   This room is fairly large, able to suit a good number of 
people comfortably. Smack in the center of the room is an 
upraised platform, bearing a holographic projector. On either 
side of said projector sit two tables, bolted to the floor. 
Harsh, blue lights burn from the low ceiling, bathing everthing 
beneath in blue tones.

   Bearing all the necessities of a messhall - a sink, a stove, a 
table - that is exactly what this room is. The sink and stove 
sit cozily against the foreward wall, with the table not far 
away. Burning blue, harsh lights are set into the low ceiling, 
casting a dull blue glow over the stainless steel environment.

A Gradually Collapsing Dead End~
   As the corridor runs from the west to the east, the ceiling 
gradually drops, as though bent under a heavy weight from above. 
Four feet of space between floor and ceiling slowly narrows to 
two feet; it is at this point where rubble, shredded electrical 
wires and broken pipes create a collapsed wall where the ceiling 
eventually managed to give out entirely. There is no path onward 
from this dead end.

At a Dead End, A Graveyard of Ancient Steel~
   This mundane corridor ends abruptly to the north. An entire 
section of the eastern wall and ceiling has collapsed inward to 
create an impossible barrier onward. Ice has overtaken some of 
the larger pieces of shrapnel, and a few others show signs of 
having melted or blackened by a forgotten fire. To the south, 
the hallway stretches normally, and that section of the frozen 
ruins seems to have retained its structural integrity.

A Short, Tilted Hallway~
   This hallways runs from north to south. It is slightly

side-by-side. The ceiling above hangs low, a scant seven feet 
up. Unpainted, the walls are the dull gray of steel - completely 
featureless.

The Corner of a Hallway~
   The corridor is cut by a neat, right-angle turn here. The 
hallways remains cramped, with tightly-pressed walls and a low 
ceiling of standard gray, unpainted steel. Some debris begins to 
clutter the walkway westward, while the northern path appears to 
be somewhat safe and unobstructed.

A Half-Ruined Hallway of Debris~
   This rubble-strewn hallway cuts west-to-east, littered with 
sharp, twisted steel debris. The corridor is difficult to 
manuever through because of the structural damage done to the 
above ceiling; there is a massive hole above. Enough frozen 
debris has collapsed along the southern wall to allow uneasy 
passage upwards to the deck above.

An Icy Bend in the Hallway~
   This hallway is slightly cramped, allowing just enough room 
for two people to walk side-by-side and little else. To the 
east, the floor is littered with jagged steel debris painted with 
white permafrost. Northwards, the corridor continues 
monotonously, and the floor grows considerably more slick. The 
ceiling above hangs low, a scant seven feet above the floor.

   The hallways runs north-to-south without much immediate change

allowing not more than two people to travel side-by-side. 
Towards the northern end of this hall, the steel floor is coated 
in slick ice.

A Ruined Hallway of Ice and Steel~
   This hallway's flat gray walls are partially collapsed on the 
western side; it would appear that some massive forced shredded 
the steel along the outside wall, causing its jagged edges to 
reach inward towards the corridor like the maw of some ancient, 
hungry beast. Several broken pipes jut out from the broken 
steal, bent and ruined themselves. A coat of thick ice covers 
the broken water pipes and spreads, like a virus, from the hole 
in the wall to the floor - making movement here a very precarious 
effort.

An Ice-and-Steel Filled Hallway~
   This corridor's flat, metallic walls are covered in ice as 
they stretch southwards. To the east, the ceiling dips mightily 
- as though some heavy weight from above warped the steel into a 
bloated remnant of the shape it once held. One would have to 
duck down to move to the east, as the ceiling hangs at some 
points no more than four feet above the floor.

A Spacious, Secured Barracks~
   This room is dominated mostly by bolted-down bunks that run 
the lengths of the walls, precisely spaced. Undecorated, the 
featureless steel that makes up the walls, roof, and floor gives 
the barracks a dull and empty feeling. The floor, complete empty 
but for the uniform bunks, seems to be one solid piece of metal, 
while the walls and low-hanging ceiling are covered in 
evenly-spaced rivets that keep the seams of the room held 
together.

Along the Hull, Staring into Blackness~
   It would be easy to say that space is cold, mind-numbingly, 
icy cold - and dark. It is cold and it is dark. It is 
absolutely frigid. Chunks of debris, pieces of hull, even the 
jagged breach itself - these are also cold, achingly cold. But 
they would not feel cold if touched, and anyone in space would 
not feel that deep, bone-shattering freeze. Anyone in a 
pressurized spacesuit would not feel the chill at all, and anyone 
not so dressed would have more pressing issues at hand: the water 
on their skin would evaporate first, their eyes would shrivel, 
and they would prune like a raisin left too long in the sun. 
Ninety seconds without oxygen and their lungs would shred. With 
oxygen, unsuited, it's a slow death: blood loss and organ 
failure. 
   The hull is featureless, flat metal, painted a dull gray. The 
space everywhere else is the opposite - black, with pinpoints of 
stars and nebulas and all that.

   Further passage is blocked (unless one were to send themselves 
hurtling into space) by a massive, bulky, blocky generator. It 
stretches out in what could be hundreds of feet along the hull of 
the ship, making all sorts of noises: whirring, clunking, 
clanking, humming, thrumming, roaring.

A Tiny Storage Room Behind the Shaft~
   This room is barely large enough for more than half a dozen or 
more people to fit comfortably in. The ceiling is perhaps six 
and a half feet up from the floor. The metallic walls and 
ceiling are painted a dark gray. The incredible amount of dust 
settling here and the stale air suggests that this storage area

The dull light is enough to illuminate the narrow shaft, but the

bottoms out here, the ladder ending at a hatch. 
   A smattering of red makes up words, directly across the hatch.

Along the Ceiling of the Engineering Deck~
   Spreading out in all directions, the deck is vast and wide, 
supported by scarce steel pillars, I-beams that stretch from 
floor to ceiling. The ladder continues to the floor (or ceiling, 
depending on one's perspective) which is cluttered with all sorts 
of machinery and consoles. Hydraulics and cogs and pistons are 
interspersed, intersected and intertwined. Some of these work 
and some do not, but a majority of the consoles and lights seem 
to be, for the most part, active - the illumination from both is 
plenty to see by.

A Descending Staircase, Within a Massive Room~
   With bright blue light reaching up from below - powerful 
enough to hurt, powerful enough to reach the high ceiling above - 
a small landing sits here, with a rickety steel staircase 
branching off of it. The steel, while unrusted, is nevertheless 
thin and flimsy; the railing is little more than rebar, and the 
staircase, with few supports, is inclined to wobble slightly as 
weight shifts atop it. 
   Set into the wall on the landing of the stair is a steel 
blastdoor.

A Rickety Staircase Over Nothing~
   The wobbly, thin staircase continues on over the blue light 
that rises from an unseen source below. There is no way to 
determine how far below the floor is or how high above the 
ceiling is - the landing to fore can just barely be made out, and 
the staircase continues on aftwards at a slight descending slope.

An Apparent Turn Upon the Staircase~
   This far along and nothing exists but the few visible yards of 
staircase and the ever-present, near-blinding blue light. The 
staircase turns here, leveling out before cutting a perfect 
ninety degree angle, from fore to port, descending the entire 
way. While logic dictates that the staircase should, by all 
means, be closer to the ground, it is still impossible to tell.

determine how far below the floor is, how high the ceiling is, or 
how far apart the walls are. The only thing one can be certain 
of is that the stairway leads continually downwards, towards the 
source of light, originating from somewhere within the bowels of 
the ship.

A Landing and a Sharp Turn~
   Another small platform sees another ninety degree turn, 
perhaps going from starboard to fore, but definitely a right-hand 
turn for anyone descending. Bearing supports, this landing could 
be almost described as sturdy, though the metal still groans and 
shifts under weight applied. They continue, the rickety things, 
downwards, to another landing, slightly visible.

   The wobbly, thin staircase continues on over the blue light 
that rises from an unseen source below. There is no way to 
determine how far below the floor is, how high the ceiling is, or 
how far apart the walls are. The only thing one can be certain 
of is that the stairway leads continually downwards, towards the 
source of light, originating from somewhere within the bowels of 
the ship.

Spiraling Downwards~
   As the wind in the stairs narrows, it becomes more visible - 
it can just be made out that the descending steps make a sort of 
spiral in the bright blue light, cutting ninety degrees at 
intervals. Here is no different, the stairs drop to a landing 
and then drop away from that landing, continuing unabated.

The End of the Staircase, an Expanse Below~
   The rickety staircase sees another landing here, and then 
finally, at length, touches the steel floor. The blue light is 
nearly overpowering, blotting out the skeletal structure of the 
staircase above.

A Humungous Chamber Housing the Engine Core~
   Swathed in brilliant blue light, this enormous chamber 
stretches up and out - with the light the far walls and ceiling 
are impossible to determine, blending in seamlessly with each 
other. The only noticeable features of this room that can be 
made out in the light are the rickety staircase that stretches up 
into nothingness, a simple square console that stands obscenely 
in the ocean of blue, and the massive engine core, the cause of 
the light, taking up nearly a fourth of the gargantuan room's 
space and emitting a monotonous drone.

A Quaint, Looted Bar and Grill~
   Cracked, peeling and even mismatched, the drab-colored paints 
on the walls of this room give off a dreary aura. On the floor 
is a series of maroon and mustard-colored tiles in a checkered 
pattern. The walls appear to be made of stone, but chips from 
some kind of bludgeoning reveal it to be a gritty gray-brown 
powder. On the eastern end of the room lies a large canvas, 
which was clearly once a background for a video projection. Now 
it is ripped nearly in half at an awkward angle and hangs 
uselessly above the floor.

   This part of the research laboratory, divided from the aft 
section by a tall partition, is rather empty. Several chairs 
line one wall, bolted to the floor, and a relatively small 
hologram machine sits in a corner of the room, opposite the 
seats. The walls are a sterile white, and the floor is tiled, 
each tile fitting seamlessly with its neighbor.

The Dead-End Against a Sealed Blast Door~
   A droning buzz radiates from the sporadically blinking lights 
mounted overhead in this narrow tube-tunnel. The entire space is 
an endless sea of grays and whites, broken only by the lurking 
shadows which bend around the embossed metal supports flanking 
the hallway. The square-paneled flooring underfoot begins a 
steep descent at the far end before abruptly meeting a thick, 
sealed blast door.

This room is activated by the xxxhackopenxxx prog in room 50138. 
That prog makes rooms 50138, 50137, 50136, 50134, 50175, and 
50132 'fall' into room 50104. This empties the old rooms 
simultaneous with relinking the exits with the new decompressed

In the Empty Void of Space, Just Outside An Open Blastdoor on a Spaceship~
   Light shines out through a blastdoor in the hull of the ship 
directly before you, a beacon of light in your gravity-less 
state. The metal hull of the ship, smooth and sleek, extends in 
each direction. Beyond that metal is only the void of space, 
empty and alone.

A Secret Den in the Tangled Undergrowth~
   Brambles laden with berries surround this area, the branches of the 
surrounding fruit trees low-hanging and heavy with fruit. They have been woven 
into an intricate canopy that winds into a living structure, like a tent that 
cocoons this places from the surroundings. Delicate glass baubles hang inside, 
some containing flickering candles that shed a soft and dancing light over the 
shady darkness while the floor is carpeted with a layer of matting woven from 
coconut fronds. Suspended from a couple of thick, sturdy branches is a wide 
#3hammock#0 of faded, striped canvas, probably just large enough for two.

A Circular Clearing with a Hot Spring~
   This small circular clearing, bleeds into another further to the east, 
although this one boasts a hot spring steaming in the absolute center of it. 
Hazy steam rises lazily from the gently bubbling water, while to the north the 
trees thicken to become impenetrable, a wall of twisted, tangled trunks and 
branches where a faint and quiet rustling can be heard along with bird song and 
the chatter of monkeys, occasional glimpses of the owners of these voices 
visible.

A Quiet, Mist-filled Fruit Grove~
   Dappled in shade and mist, secretive this grove is populated by fruit trees 
and naturally roughly cleared into a circular shape, a few flat rocks scattered 
around the perimeter. A large, soft blanket of a rich turquoise is spread out 
on the sandy ground, strewn with silky cushions in jewel like shades of purple 
and blue, embroidered with tiny stars in silver thread. The surrounding 
rainforest is thick and impenetrable, although the trees form an archway to the 
north and to the south, a cluster of weather worn wooden bungalows can be 
glimpsed though the vegetation.

   A simple hut, this bungalow is bright and airy with rough hewn wooden walls 
and rush matting floors, the rainforest visible through the open windows that 
let in the gentle tropical breeze and the distant call of the ocean. The 
underside of the thatching above is visible, as well as the intricate wooden 
pegs and beams that support it, everything in neutral and calming colours but 
for the exotic fresh fruit that sits in a driftwood bowl on the table.

A Clearing Before a Weathered Bungalow~
   From here, the ocean is still visible to the south through the trees that 
crown the crest of a hill thats too steep to scramble down. The sand is 
sparser, mixed through with scraggly grass and twigs from the surrounding 
bushes. Numerous flowers punctuate the surroundings with flashes of bright 
colour and birds call to each other from the surrounding rainforest. In a ring 
of carefully arranged stones, a small fire burns, tendrils of smoke curling 
upwards towards the sky through a gap in the canopy above.

   The path splits here around a #3rock#0 settled right in the centre, perfect 
for climbing and sitting, carved with various names and numbers in haphazard 
scatter. It continues eastward through a pair of coconut trees where a small, 
weathered wooden bungalow is visible in the distance. Its cooler here, 
sheltered by the towering rock face to the west, slick with soft green moss 
where a tumble of water cascades in a small waterfall that ends in a stream 
that disappears into the trees.

The Start of a Path Through the Rainforest~
   Here, the beach gives way to a misty, tree-laden tropical forest, the sand 
cooler underfoot where the path begins to trail through lush vegetation. A 
multitude of flowers bloom, the colours bright and vivid against the glossy 
greens of the leaves, which rustle as a slight breeze winds lazily through 
them. A rough, craggy rock face to the west blocks further progress in that 
direction, and the gentle rush of the ocean can still be heard from the south.

   Unfettered views of a vast and uninterrupted stretch of rolling ocean 
stretch out to the south, the gentle curve of the Earth just visible where the 
water meets the horizon. The white crested waves of the impossibly blue water 
lap at the shore, golden sand warm under foot and scattered with tiny shells. 
The beach continues to the east and west in a curve, this section seeming to be 
an inset bay thats part of a larger coastline, while the ground slops up 
dramatically northwards towards a tropical rainforest that flourishes at the 
top of the hill.

A Sheltered Corner of Rocky Tidal Pools~
   Set into the corner of the bay, the rocks here have been worn smooth by the 
kiss of the waves, stepped up into a series of interlinked tidal pools, 
currently cut off from the rest of the ocean. They are blissfully warm and 
clear, with starfish and crabs and other marine wildlife hiding in the crevices 
and fronds of seaweed that sway beneath the surface of the sparkling water. A 
steep rocky outcropping from the north snakes around the pools, blocking 
further progress east while behind while leaving the view of the ocean and the 
clear sky visible to the south.
