An Eternally Dark Chasm~
   Ice, stone, and perpetual darkness make up the entirety of 
this chasm's non-to-cheery interior. The rocks of the wall stand 
solidly, hundreds of feet in the air; they reach impossibly high, 
and only thin slivers of the purplish gray sky can be seen beyond 
them. Strewn across the ground is an occasional rock or group of 
rocks, fallen from the heights above.

An Eternally Dark Chasm~
   This deep chasm runs well beneath the surface of the moon. 
Its sheer walls and narrowness prevent all sunlight from reaching 
the bottom - it in plunged into infinite darkness. The bottom of 
the gorge is lined with the occasional rockfall. Some of the 
rocks are covered in a thin layer of frost, but it is mostly a 
dry, barren little rift bottom without vegetation. If one were 
to pay enough attention, they would notice that most of these 
spots of frost are a dark crimson in color - some, also, contain 
frozen bodyparts, such as fingers, toes, and pieces of organs.

The Chasm of Eternal Night~
   This chasm is absolutely, unquestionably dark - the high, 
jagged, frost-covered walls reach high enough to block out 
sunlight eternally. Silence and cold make up the rest of this 
area; the smallest scrape can echo up and down the craggy rocks, 
making traveling unheard nearly impossible. Strewn across the 
ground is an occasional rock or group of rocks, fallen from the 
heights above. Darkness surrounds.

An Eternally Dark Chasm~
   Jagged walls of moon rock jut upwards, impossibly high, 
offering naught but the most linear path through this chasm. The 
rocks stand solidly, hundreds of feet in the air; they reach 
impossibly high, and only thin slivers of the purplish gray sky 
can be seen beyond them. Frost and ice permeate this area, 
black-on-black, making footing tricky at best. All around, this 
chasm is eternally thrust into darkness; No light reaches this 
place.

The Massive, Toothy Entrance to a Cave~
   A giant hole, perhaps twenty-five feet in diameter, gapes to 
the east, just as dark, if not darker, than the chasm that 
surrounds it. The jagged moon rock that makes up the mouth leers 
outwards at oncomers and appear as teeth - jutting, serrated, 
gnarled teeth that threaten to ensnare, to chew, to devour. Wind 
whistles in and out of the confines of the cave in a steady, 
rythmic pattern; the cave seems to be breathing.

A Deep Dark Cave~
   Cast perpetually into chilling darkness, this yawning tunnel 
stretches away from the chasm outside, crawling further into the 
rock of the moon. Crumbled and dusty gravel litters the entrance 
and finds its way in, though it soon peters into the shallow 
basin making up its confines. The inside of the cave is as wide 
and broad as the mouth that leads inside, and though the stone of 
its walls is rough and ragged, there are no other geological 
features save a few puddles of liquid frozen into dark, amorphous 
shapes.

A Deep Dark Cave~
   Bone-numbing cold and unrelenting gloom form the brunt of the 
atmosphere along this relentlessly large tunnel. The rough walls 
reach to a high arc somewhere overhead, undiscernable through the 
endless darkness. The floor is also rock, dusted with greyish 
dirt. Some liquid seems to have found its way into this part of 
the cavern, as small, glittering icicles hang from a few of the 
claustrophobic walls, though their provenance is unclear.

A Deep Dark Cave~
   The roof of this massive cave arcs high overhead, nearly lost 
in the infinite darkness. The floor is worn fairly smooth, but 
the walls are nothing but jagged rocks, reaching out like claws 
to snag at anyone who ventures close enough. Besides the 
whistling of the wind, the cave is absolutely silent, and dark.

A Dead-end - a Flat Stone Wall~
   Bone-numbing cold and unrelenting gloom form the brunt of the 
atmosphere along this relentlessly large tunnel. The rough walls 
reach to a high arc somewhere overhead, undiscernable through the 
endless darkness. The floor is also rock, dusted with greyish 
dirt. Some liquid seems to have found its way into this part of 
the cavern, as small, glittering icicles hang from a few of the 
claustrophobic walls, though their provenance is unclear. 
   The cave ends rather abruptly here - to the east it just stops 
at a vertical stone wall. The wall is oddly smooth compared to 
the jagged stone of the north and south walls, but it in 
nevertheless impassable.

A Dead-end - a Massive, Red-Filled Cavern~
   The darkness of this cavern makes it impossible to discern its 
size; its walls and ceiling stretch away into the eternal dark to 
points unseen. The floor of the cavern is worn smooth, but is 
slick with frost and ice - all of this ice is frozen a dark red. 
Navigating the floor would prove trick as, along with the ice, 
body parts of various creatures are also strewn haphazardly 
around, frozen to the floor, immobile. The scent of cold, death, 
and frozen blood fills the air.
