An Ancient, Grand Sewer~
   This sewer has been built needlessly grand; The concrete walls 
stand strong, even against the tests of time and rebuilding. As 
old as they are, one can still notice that these tunnels are 
nevertheless elaborate - the gulley that would hold waste runs 
down the center of the tunnel, and each side of that is flanked 
by wide sidewalks. Along the walls have been built concrete 
pillars, about half a food in diamater, spaced about every five 
yards - the support no weight, and are built purely for asthetic 
purposes. Small footbridges are set evenly with the pillars, 
spanning the now-empty gulley's length, allowing a person to walk 
from one side to the other.

An Ancient, Grand Sewer~
   This sewer has been built needlessly grand; The concrete walls 
stand strong, even against the tests of time and rebuilding. As 
old as they are, one can still notice that these tunnels are 
nevertheless elaborate - the gulley that would hold waste runs 
down the center of the tunnel, and each side of that is flanked 
by wide sidewalks. Along the walls have been built concrete 
pillars, about half a food in diamater, spaced about every five 
yards - the support no weight, and are built purely for asthetic 
purposes. Small footbridges are set evenly with the pillars, 
spanning the now-empty gulley's length, allowing a person to walk 
from one side to the other. 
   A small crack lies in the western wall, just large enough for 
a humanoid.

An Ancient, Grand Sewer~
   This sewer has been built needlessly grand; The concrete walls 
stand strong, even against the tests of time and rebuilding. As 
old as they are, one can still notice that these tunnels are 
nevertheless elaborate - the gulley that would hold waste runs 
down the center of the tunnel, and each side of that is flanked 
by wide sidewalks. Along the walls have been built concrete 
pillars, about half a food in diamater, spaced about every five 
yards - the support no weight, and are built purely for asthetic 
purposes. Small footbridges are set evenly with the pillars, 
spanning the now-empty gulley's length, allowing a person to walk 
from one side to the other.

   This sewer has been built needlessly grand; The concrete walls 
stand strong, even against the tests of time and rebuilding. As 
old as they are, one can still notice that these tunnels are 
nevertheless elaborate - the gulley that would hold waste runs 
down the center of the tunnel, and each side of that is flanked 
by wide sidewalks. Along the walls have been built concrete 
pillars, about half a food in diamater, spaced about every five 
yards - the support no weight, and are built purely for asthetic 
purposes. Small footbridges are set evenly with the pillars, 
spanning the now-empty gulley's length, allowing a person to walk 
from one side to the other.

A Narrow, Foul-Smelling Tunnel~

halfway collapsed upon itself - stone clots up most of the room, 
and makes traveling through nearly impossible. Caved in walls 
block most paths of eggression, offering little more than a 
strict, linear path. Evidence that this was once a sewer stains 
the walls in browns and blacks.

and makes traveling through nearly impossible. Caved in walls 
block most paths of eggression, offering little more than a 
strict, linear path. Evidence that this was once a sewer stains 
the walls in browns and blacks; now, however, it is completely 
dry and stenchless. 
   To the north is a massive cesspool, once fenced off by railing 
that has all but rusted away. Dominating the available groud 
here is a crude painting: a skull-and-crossbones, painted in 
white and nearly covered with sludge. An arrow has been painted 
beside this image, pointing north.

A Massive Cesspool~
   A large, roughly circular pool of murky, stagnant waste 
dominates the area, its circumference ringed by a rusty, wasted 
encrusted railing. The odor of harsh chemicals and waste mingle 
here, creating a gagging, overpowering atmosphere. Moist clumps 
of sewage and debris periodically drain from a series of 
interconnected plumbing systems overhead, creating a frequent 
gurgling that echoes.

Beneath the Shit-Brown Waters~
   Filth and muck are all that one could possible see beneath the 
waste-filled surface of the cesspool. This semi-solid mass 
proves hard to move in, much less swim, and the chemicals used to 
treat the filth would probably kill a man in a minute. It isn't 
a very pleasant place to be.

A Narrow Landing With a Ladder~
   This ledge juts away from the cesspool, and would lead east 
and west if the tunnels hadn't crumbled away with time, leaving a 
tangle of concrete chunks and twisted railing. The cesspool 
stretches off to the south, and a narrow, rickety ladder is set 
into a carved tunnel to the north, leading further down.

A Claustrophobic Tunnel~
   This narrow tunnel is made tighter by the fact that it is 
halfway collapsed upon itself - stone clots up most of the room, 
and makes traveling through nearly impossible. Caved in walls 
block most paths of eggression, offering little more than a 
strict, linear path. Evidence that this was once a sewer stains 
the walls in browns and blacks; now, however, it is completely 
dry and stenchless.

A Grate Opens Up to Forgotten Tunnels~
   These tunnels, while old, are of a very obvious better make 
than the tunnels above. The concrete walls stand strong, even 
against the tests of time and rebuilding. As old as they are, 
one can still notice that these tunnels are needlessly elaborate 
- the gulley that would hold waste runs down the center of the 
tunnel, and each side of that is flanked by wide sidewalks. 
Along the walls have been built concrete pillars, about half a 
food in diamater, spaced about every five yards - the support no 
weight, and are built purely for asthetic purposes. Small 
footbridges are set evenly with the pillars, spanning the 
now-empty gulley's length, allowing a person to walk from one 
side to the other.

Along an Old, Steel Ladder~
   This ladder rises through the ancient sewers, impossibly high. 
The walls are slate gray concrete, absolutely featureless, even 
in construction - the walls are absolutely smooth and uncracked. 
The corroded ladder has seen better days, but it stays solid 
under weight applied. 
   Scrawled along the wall, at arm's length, with a space in it 
where the ladder seperates the words, is the message: "#1Sir! I 
think you'd better take my         hand and pray we make this

A Spiralling Tunnel~
   This tunnel is no less elaborate than the sewers that preceded 
it - the walls are made up of concrete bricks, and the ground is 
tiled. It spirals up to the right, twisting through the 
darkness. 
   Scrawled over the wall, a blemish on an otherwise immaculate 
surface, are the words: "#1You've done everything you can do.#0"

"#1...something of the other does, too.#0"

A Dilapidated Sewer Tunnel~
   This derelict section of tunnel is long past its era of use, 
the conveyer belt that once carried wastage inert and ripped in 
numerous places. Husks of broken hauling robots and shells of 
machinery are scattered about in no apparent order, as if they 
were suddenly left behind. A few cables hang from the ceiling at 
irregular intervals, some sporting perforated sprinkler-heads, 
others stripped and revealing the bare wire beneath.

A Dilapidated Sewer Tunnel~
   It is obvious whatever this tunnel used to transport has been 
dysfunctional for a long period of time, for the conveyer belt 
that runs through it is cannibalized and a thick layer of dust 
clings to the remains. Portions of the abandoned tunnel are 
scored with gores, slashes, and gaping holes, and even claw 
marks. A nauseating smell permeates this dimly lit tunnel, 
stinging the eyes and making the task of breathing arduous.

A Dilapidated Sewer Tunnel~
   This section of the sewer is fairly cleaner than most, only a 
few piles of steaming waste dotting the floor and collecting at 
the edges of the tunnel. Ambiguous fluids have been splattered 
in some unintentional vague mural across the wall, some 
distinctly dark crimson, puke-brown, and sickly green. The stale 
scent of undisturbed dust hangs heavily in the area.

A Dilapidated Sewer Tunnel~
   The abandoned tunnel suddenly slopes upward, and traversing is 
difficult, requiring using makeshift footholds on the conveyer 
belt. Mounds of moist earth and fetid waste are piled high to 
the sides of the pitted cement walls, some reaching the ceiling 
and others showing recent efforts of being moved about. A fetid, 
musky smell is overpowering to the senses here, as though this 
area laid it bare, the concrete walls unable to mask it.

A Dilapidated Sewer Tunnel~
   Leveled in some places, passage through this tunnel is 
difficult as debris and random sewage sit high in seemingly 
random piles. A few poorly maintained, waste covered robots rest 
against the wall between mounds of excrement, while others lie 
tipped upon their sides, or hunched motionless near an indention 
of waste. The smell is faintly rank here, a creeping sense of 
decay that clings to the stained dirtied walls.

A Dilapidated Sewer Tunnel ~
   The abandoned tunnel suddenly slopes upward, and traversing is 
difficult, requiring using makeshift footholds on the conveyer 
belt. Mounds of moist earth and fetid waste are piled high to 
the sides of the pitted cement walls, some reaching the ceiling 
and others showing recent efforts of being moved about. The 
smell is faintly rank here, a creeping sense of decay that clings 
to the stained dirtied walls.

A Dilapidated Sewer Tunnel ~
   The abandoned tunnel suddenly slopes downward, deeper into the 
Moon, and the area is curiously devoid of any debris save for the 
ruined conveyer belt. Portions of the abandoned tunnel are 
scored with gores, slashes, and gaping holes, and even claw 
marks. The iron smell of blood permeates the area like a morbid 
perfume.

   It is obvious whatever this tunnel used to transport has been 
dysfunctional for a long period of time, for the conveyer belt

In a Short, Stained Tunnel~
   This tunnel is small, perhaps twenty feet in length and wide 
enough for five humans to stand abreast. Beginning at an aged 
chrion door marked with a crude spraypainting of a wrench, it 
serves as a connection between the sewer's ruined expanse outside 
and this seperate wing. The air here smells cleaner, feels 
lighter, though the floor and walls here are erratically stained 
dark in a myriad of concrete patterns, layered and ancient in the 
concrete. 

This place is poorly lit by guttering torches casting off a weak, 
oily luminescence.

   A plain, square room of greyish, stained concrete, this 
chamber's original purpose is unclear. It has long been cleared 
of any identifying furnishings or equipment, leaving it bare and 
relatively clean. Overhead, ancient sprinkler-heads dot the 
ceiling. It serves now only as a node between the narrow tunnels 
to the south and east.

it was made inexpertly by hand or some lumbering, careless, 
sightless machine in ages past.

An Expansive, Cavernous Room~
   The narrow southern tunnel descends into this vast room via a 
short ramp leading down into the expanse. Walls of rough, 
irregular, stained concrete rise high into a ceiling somewhere in 
the distant darkness above. Ancient, wrecked trackings mar the 
floor here, suggesting a network of conveyor belts ran this 
ground long ago. Rectangular areas of pitted depressions and 
deep scratches in the floor are doubtless the relics of great 
weights that once abused the rock underfoot, likely the legacies 
of large, lost machinery.

A Winding, Elbow-Shaped Tunnel~
   This tunnel gently slopes further down into the moon as it 
bends to the north. Like the others in this wing, the slope of 
this passage is irregular and pitted. As the passage winds and 
turns down, the air grows cooler and cleaner. Close inspection 
of the walls reveals they are damp but not filthy as elsewhere in 
the sewers.

The Johnny/Jackie Lewis Bar and Memorial Headquarters~
   Affixed to the wall above a long makeshift bar here is a giant 
poster of a two-headed mutant clutching two microphones, one for 
each of his distended mouths. The man, dressed in shimmering, 
stylish polymesh, is up on his toes in a graceful pose as he 
sings, a yellow starburst graphic filling the poster behind him. 
Similar, smaller advertisements, featuring the glittering mutant 
in various poses and scenarios ("Johnny/Jackie rocks Tram 
City!"), cover the walls here and memorabilia line the shelves. 
The proprietor is clearly the Moon's biggest fan of Johnny/Jackie 
Lewis, a celebrated mutant performer in ages past known for 
having two heads but only one and a half brains and a similar 
number of personalities. The decorations manage to impart some 
warmth to this room, and the simplicity of the furnishings helps 
create a cozy atmosphere despite the cold concrete enclosing it.

A Dark, Damp Chamber~
   The walls of this chamber are rough and glossy with moisture, 
glittering like illuminated yet ugly jewels. Tiny mushrooms dot 
the walls and ground here, thriving in the darkness and the damp, 
cool air. The source of the moisture, a clear, cold pool of 
water, claims most of this place. In the pool, a careful eye 
with the aid of light can spy a pipe running through it. The 
water flows slothfully elsewhere through a large crack at the 
bottom of the western wall, its motion almost imperceptible, 
resulting in a near-constant water level.

endures, tenuous in ruin.

   Several shelves occupy the concrete wallspace here. The 
monotony of the shelving is interrupted only by faded posters and 
advertisements that have almost merged with the wall, one on top 
of the other, such is the thickness of their application and 
apparent age. Whatever words, warnings or enticements the 
posters once held is lost under dirt, wear and color long 
diminished. A thick metal door interrupts the shelving to the 
north.

lacking any kind of uniform padding or mattress, fill this room. 
The majority of the beds, to spare their occupants the discomfort 
of the cold, hard metal frames, have been haphazardly piled with 
scraps of old plastic or fabric. Lacking space for other 
furnishings, the stained concrete of the walls and low ceiling is 
the only entertainment available to a body at rest. 

This place is poorly lit by guttering torches casting off a weak, 
oily luminescence.

A Chamber with an Altar~
   In the center of this small chamber, its walls the stained, 
bare concrete ubiquitous in this place, lies an altar of stone, a 
crude rectangular block man-sized and featureless save for heavy, 
dark staining. Circumscribing the altar is a black circle of 
spraypaint, five feet from the stone block at any point.

In a Cramped Laboratory~
   This room lies in disarray. Shelves hold rows of dust-covered 
implements of metal or polyprop, old and of questionable utility. 
A stained, wheeled, dented metal table stands amongst scattered 
and forgotten tools, many ruined by time or lack of care.

A Rough Alcove~
   Unlike the uniform concrete elsewhere in this wing, this tiny 
alcove, large enough for a few adult humans, has been hacked out 
of the moon's rock. Natural and raw, the floor and walls here 
are unworked stone, stained in many places.

Children's Creche~
   This room is clearly used as a dormitory, though only a few 
bunks are present. Most of the floor has been occupied by piles 
of polyprop rags, clumps of fabric and refuse cobbled together in 
sad impressions of respectable bedding. Old toys lie scattered.
