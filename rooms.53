Outside the Northern Gates~
   The purplish-gray sky looms overhead, offering no respite to 
this monotonous road. Hard packed dirt leads onwards as a 
noticeable road, plunging paste the featureless plains to the 
distance beyond. Every now and then a scraggly weed can be seen 
on the edge of the road, fighting for a meager existence. Even 
rarer is noticed a form of critter - small beetles that dark back 
and forth over the hard road. 
   To the south looms the forty-foot-tall Perimeter and the 
massive gate into Rust. You realize you must #6CALL

The Highway Continues~
   This road is not paved in the slightest; it is dirt, packed 
hard by the passing of thousands of feet over the span of several 
years. On either side of the road there is not much to see - 
looser dirt, rocks, craters, cracks, and weeds make up the 
entirety of the view until the ground eventually disappears 
beyond the horizon.

A Fork in the Road~
   Hard-packed dirt marches a mostly-straight road across the 
otherwise loose dirt of the moon plains. The purplish-gray sky 
looms overhead, offering no respite to this monotonous road. 
Small rocks are strewn haphazardly over the road, but offer no 
real challenge to travel. Every so often a weed lies on the 
road, crushed into the dirt by some passing foot. 
   Passage to the east is thwarted by high mountains and verticle 
cliff-faces, forming an impenetrable wall of moon rock.

the break the endless monotony. The purlish sky is even infected

A Long Stretch of Ancient Highway~
   Monotonous gray makes up the entirety of this area's color 
palette. The hard dirt that makes the road is gray, the loose 
dirt that makes up the plains is gray, the boulders and craters 
that little the plains is gray - even the few weeds that manage 
to break through the unfertile soil are gray. The sky overhead 
offers no respite; it is a deep purple above, but fades to gray 
once it gets to the horizon.

   The highway turns rather apruptly here to the west, as to the 
north it runs out of land to follow. A giant crater is dug out 
into the ground, perhaps twenty or thirty feet deep.

paste the featureless plains to the distance beyond. Small rocks 
are strewn haphazardly over the road, but offer no real challenge 
to travel. Gray invades all colors here, offering nothing at all 
the break the endless monotony. The purlish sky is even infected 
by that gray - the edges of the horizon bear the color dully.

A Sudden Twist in the Road~
   Monotonous gray makes up the entirety of this area's color 
palette. The hard dirt that makes the road is gray, the loose 
dirt that makes up the plains is gray, the boulders and craters 
that little the plains is gray - even the few weeds that manage 
to break through the unfertile soil are gray. The sky overhead 
offers no respite; it is a deep purple above, but fades to gray 
once it gets to the horizon.

A Highway Bend~
   This road is not paved in the slightest; it is dirt, packed 
hard by the passing of thousands of feet over the span of several 
years. On either side of the road there is not much to see - 
looser dirt, rocks, craters, cracks, and weeds make up the 
entirety of the view until the ground eventually disappears 
beyond the horizon.

An Endless Stretch of Highway~
   The purplish-gray sky looms overhead, offering no respite to 
this monotonous road. Hard packed dirt leads onwards as a 
noticeable road, plunging paste the featureless plains to the 
distance beyond. Every now and then a scraggly weed can be seen 
on the edge of the road, fighting for a meager existence. Even 
rarer is noticed a form of critter - small beetles that dark back 
and forth over the hard road.

A Broken Road~
   Hard-packed dirt marches a mostly-straight road across the 
otherwise loose dirt of the moon plains. The purplish-gray sky

Small rocks are strewn haphazardly over the road, but offer no 
real challenge to travel. Every so often a weed lies on the 
road, crushed into the dirt by some passing foot.

A Well-trod Dirt Road~
   Hard, packed dirt leads onwards as a noticeable road, plunging 
paste the featureless plains to the distance beyond. Small rocks 
are strewn haphazardly over the road, but offer no real challenge 
to travel. Gray invades all colors here, offering nothing at all 
the break the endless monotony. The purlish sky is even infected 
by that gray - the edges of the horizon bear the color dully.

A Well-trod Dirt Road~
   This road is not paved in the slightest; it is dirt, packed 
hard by the passing of thousands of feet over the span of several 
years. On either side of the road there is not much to see - 
looser dirt, rocks, craters, cracks, and weeds make up the 
entirety of the view until the ground eventually disappears 
beyond the horizon.

this monotonous road. Hard packed dirt leads onwards as a

on the edge of the road, fighting for a meager existence. Even 
rarer is noticed a form of critter - small beetles that dark back

A Path Beside the Entrance to a Giant Windmill~
   This road beats a rough path through mounds of ruins. It is 
not paved in the slightest; it is dirt, packed hard by the 
passing of thousands of feet over the span of several years. To 
the south stretches a few rows of abandoned housing - all that 
has not been burned or looted or collapsed is nothing now but 
empty, roofless husks. 
   A door sits just to the north of the trail, leading to a small 
building that sits just under massive windmill. The thing stands 
monolithic, made entirely of concrete but for the four steel 
rotors that sit dead in place, unmoving.

Fractured by craters and gulleys, hills like these rise up on the

rounding the rough edges of the rocks beneath.

Moonlands Near a Wall~
   These plains are an ocean of gray dirt, broken every so often by rocks and 
craters. Weeds cling desperately to life and seem to generally be failing - 
the scraggly things are withered and broken. The only thing that seems to be 
making any cort of progress in this empty place is dirt, as there is a ton of 
it. It lies fairly loose atop the rock, and puffs up whenever stepped on.

Moonplains Near a Cliff~
   The grey, featureless landscape drops away sharply and suddenly here in a 
long cliff that stretches down to the south, just more of the bleak and 
unbreaking monotony of the surroundings continuing below. Northwards, the 
imposing dome of the Hyperion Platform is visible, glinting when it catches the 
light but somehow forbidding while to the west, the moon plains continue 
onwards.

Near Bleak Grey Cliffs~
   The plains here are interrupted, slipping away suddenly to the west in a 
series of steep and rocky cliffs. Scraggly, withered weeds cluster in the 
shelter of rocks and boulders, struggling to survive in the harsh surroundings 
and often only loosely rooted in the thick, clinging dirt.

Nearing an Old Factory~
   West of here, the rusted structure of an old factory of some kind is 
visible, a pitted metal building that stands behind a fence, inaccessible from 
here. Northwards, the plains continue while to the south and east, they seem 
to be interrupted by a sharp drop. Thick moon dust clings to everything, 
cloying and sticky while small rocks and larger boulders scatter the ground.

On The Edge of a Cliff~
   South of here, the ground ends abruptly in a series of sharp cliffs, the 
plains picking up again far, far below. The ground here is strewn with rocks 
and boulders of various sizes and off to the west stands a large, rusted old 
building that might once have been a factory, its silhouette easily visible 
against the bleak grey of the plains.

Scattered Ruins~
   Partially destroyed concrete walls, torn up streets and bits 
of debris mark this area as part of a much larger segment of 
ruins, stretching along the shore of Crater Lake to the 
southwest. Not too far in the distance, also to the southwest, 
is a tall, large old factory, pitted metal and thick layers of 
rust.

to generally be failing - the scraggly things are withered and 
broken. The only thing that seems to be making any cort of

It lies fairly loose atop the rock, and puffs up whenever stepped

Nearing An Ancient Building~
   Ruins dead-end here at the demolished, hanging metal gate to a 
great, old building. The gate itself is warped, twisted, and 
barely remains upright - still, it could be (with effort) still 
opened or closed, though it would make a considerable racket. 
The factory itself is an omnious, forbidding presence: all rust, 
metal and dry, crumbling stagnation.

Inside An Ancient Factory~
   This old factory creaks and groans, in a constant state of 
settle and resettle. Its metal shell is pitted and rusting, 
though its concrete pillars remain solid and sturdy, and the high 
ceiling gives this already large factory a cavernous feel. 
Machinery lines the ceiling and walls and takes up large segments 
of the floor - all old, rusting and inert.

stones. A low-lying concrete wall marks what may have once been

edge of a narrow, broken street. Several other streets, also 
broken, intersect here and travel northward.

trenches. These 'streets' twist southward, continuing a short

debris is smaller in nature, easily mistaken as just another part 
of the turbulent topography: rocks and dirt.

Empty Moonsea~
   Anything attempting to eek out a meager existence among the 
plains of the moon has its work cut out for it. The ground is 
covered by naught living but the hardiest of weeds - even the 
sight of bugs or other critters is rare. The dust-covered ground 
is littered with rocks and craters, dotting the area here and 
there and everywhere.

Rocky Landscape~
   The dusty moonscape stretches out in all directions. 
Everywhere one might step is uneven and awkward for traveling 
across, with small meteorite holes covering the surface. The 
dust is thick here, exploding out a thick powdery mist whenever 
stepped on. Dirty, dry, and barren, these plains are about as 
empty as it gets.

Near an Ancient Highway~
   The monochromatic terrain convulsed upon itself at some point, 
wrenching into a series of rolling hills with gentle slopes. 
Fractured by craters and gulleys, hills like these rise up on the 
borders of a lunar plane. Gray dust has coated the hills, 
rounding the rough edges of the rocks beneath.

Near Ruins and a Road~
   The dusty moonscape stretches out in all directions. Craters 
of various sizes pockmark the otherwise generally level ground. 
Chunks of melted rock ring some of the larger craters. The dry, 
loose lunar dust bears a criss-crossing network of tracks, mute 
testament to others progress through the area. The pervasive 
impact sites of extra-lunar material split some of the trails.

At the Edge of Some Ruins~
   Ruins creep in here across the vast plains, rubble dotted and 
otherwise desolate and dead and dry. A large, metal building of 
some sort is visible to the west, and further ruins stretch to 
the northwest and southeast, respectively, straight to Crater 
Lake in the far distance.

In the Midst of the Ruins~
   Ruins stretch out in all directions from here, as either 
collapsed or intact buildings, bits of concrete rubble, or old 
plastic sheeting and mangled, pitted and rusted iron. There is 
no real pattern or logic to the chaos of this area, though to the 
northwest a larger building is visible, preserved from the rot.

Tall Ruins~
   The ruins here are taller than the rest of the great stretch 
of rubble - low-lying walls that elsewhere reach only to the 
ankles or thighs rise easily over the height of an average man, 
and the empty shells of three-walled buildings dot the area, 
entire sides of the building shorn away, or collapsed inward and 
utterly open to the elements.

In the Shadow of an Ancient Billboard~
   The most noticeable thing here among the rubble and ruin is a 
large, ancient billboard sign stretching some distance up and out 
- faded and unrecognizable, but still gaudily done up, cheaply 
plastic and reeking of chemicals even now. An old ladder once 
allowed access up to the billboard sign, but has sign been torn 
away and is in fragments somewhere with the rest of the ruin.

Through a Field of Broken Homes~
   Ruined buildings litter the area, most uniform in size and 
shape and many still in fairly good condition - still standing, 
four-walled, with a door, though most doors have been broken in 
and the roofing of many houses is in a state of severe collapse. 
Ruins stretch to the north and, a little ways past desolate 
plains, more ruins stretch to the south, too. 
   To the west, an open doorway leads to an empty, small 
building.

A Small Hill~

meteorite holes covering the surface. The holes range from 
barely noticeable indents to caping holes large enough to hide a 
small man or animal. Everywhere one looks is grey bleakness and

The Empty Shell of a Building~
   This building is empty, fairly small, and strangely silent. 
It is a single, four-walled room, with no smaller rooms, hallways 
or divisions, and opens to the outside by way of a doorway to the 
east, and a large hole in the back wall to the west. The floor, 
textured plastic, is free from debris or dirt.

building is visible. A medium-sized hole has been made in the 
concrete there, allowing for free passage in and out of the 
building. Some concrete blocks have been stacked to one side of 
this hole, some gray dirt lying on the tops of the block pyramid.

Pathway Between Two Buildings~
   This narrow road runs from the back of one building to the 
side of another with no discernible point or purpose in the path 
- it leads straight from one wall to another, and is clear of 
debris or rubble. To the west, the gray plains open up. To the 
east, a hole in the back wall of a building allows access inside.

A Charred, Metal-Walled Building~
   Four metal walls form this small building, which appears to 
have been in the past some sort of storeroom - shelving lines the 
walls, and the floor is smooth and flat. A broken light hangs 
from a low ceiling, the wiring melted, cracked and ruined 
utterly. The entire room smells strangely chemical, acrid, and 
foul. Black char smears every visible surface; the metal shelves 
are corroding.

Barren, Gray Paved Field~
   This paved field is only distinguishable from the gray plains 
around it by the fact that it is smooth and even more featureless 
than the rest of the landscape. Ruins run to the northeast, east 
and south - buildings, more or less, butted up to a large factory 
complex to the east.

Empty Housing Near a Building Complex~
   Empty houses line an old, paved road here which continues on 
to the south, where it ends in a large, flat, paved, gray field. 
It also stretches a short ways to the east, where it ends at the 
front of a charred, metal-walled building. In all other 
directions but east - where the ruins continue - run the desolate 
plains and featureless topography of the moon.

front of a much smaller building with an unassuming, plastic, 
scuffed door. The front of the door is charred and blackened.

   A path forms here, running from the south to turn sharply to

paths among the ruins, stretching to the further south and east 
across the desolation, they are unconnected from this lonely 
segment, which is coated in gray silt.

By a Big Building Complex~
   This metal building rises up among the shorter, diminished 
ruins like some great, pitted metal hulk, or man-made cavernous 
mouth, darkness creeping out from behind the broad, rusted metal 
door to the south that seals it - most often - shut. It, aside 
from the rust and pit-marks, is well preserved, and the rubble 
around it keeps out of this structure's shadow.

A Path Through some Ruins~
   A path branches off from the west and runs a ways to the south 
and east, dead-ending in both respects at the twisted, plastic 
hulks of old storage huts. Each hut has a jammed, fused-shut 
door, no windows, and one hut leans drunkenly toward the other, 
the ground near it uneven and bland gray.

single, great metal door to the west. The land about this wall 
is barren and spotted periodically with rocky rubble, but is 
otherwise barren and bland - it is an unappealing, ugly

A Dilapidated Reception Area~
   This dilapidated room stinks of rust, wet earth and musty 
decay. The walls are tiled with smoothed squares of plastic, 
though these have fallen away in places to reveal the rougher 
concrete beneath, and the floor is made from the same plastic, 
only textured to keep slippage to a minimum. A desk sits in the 
middle of the room, made from plastic, and is coated thickly by 
dust and plaster.
   A large, open arch to the south reveals a much larger room 
full of broken machinery.

machinery that has long since broken down into useless, rusting 
hulks, their original purpose undeterminable. The walls, floor 
and ceiling of this large room are concrete. There are no

to the east an open extension of the hall leads to a smaller work

Nearing a Settlement~
   The desolate landscape stretches out towards some distant 
hills on the horizon where the land meets with some ragged cliffs 
and high ground. The relatively flat plains here, though, are 
pock marked with craters and some ravines, making the going 
difficult despite the mostly level nature of the ground.

In the Shadow of the Mountains~
   Dry and barren, the land here is rough. Grey dust gets kicked 
up by passersby who try to traverse the rocky plains. The rocks 
are of various sizes, from house-sized boulders to pebbles 
perfectly designed to infiltrate a boot. The dust is thick 
enough that more than a few of these rocks are camouflaged until 
kicked.

Along a Half-Melted Steel Wall~
   The wall here is badly damaged, melted and blackened, hardly much of a 
protection at all. Some of the sand nearby has been turned to glass.

Empty Moonplains~
   These plains are an ocean of gray dirt, broken every so often by rocks and 
craters. Weeds cling desperately to life and seem to generally be failing - 
the scraggly things are withered and broken. The only thing that seems to be 
making any cort of progress in this empty place is dirt, as there is a ton of 
it. It lies fairly loose atop the rock, and puffs up whenever stepped on. To 
the south, a fourty-foot Perimeter surrounds Rust. It appears to have been 
partially destroyed, metal bulging outwards or torn asunder.

Beside a Somewhat Collapsed Steel Wall~
   The old description was: 
   This area of walk seems lifeless and barren. Everywhere one might step is 
uneven and awkward for traveling across, with small meteorite holes covering 
the surface. The holes range from barely noticeable indents to caping holes 
large enough to hide a small man or animal. Everywhere one looks is grey 
bleakness and inhospitable landscape. Portions of the wall to the west are 
knocked outwards, bowing low to the ground, and marred by fire.

horizon where the land meets with some ragged cliffs and high ground. The 
relatively flat plains here, though, are pock marked with craters and some 
ravines, making the going difficult despite the mostly level nature of the 
ground. The steel walls surrounding Rust have been hit by concussive blows, 
holes punched into parts and others knocked into the dust.

Curtains of Steel that were a Wall~
   This area of walk seems lifeless and barren. Everywhere one might step is 
uneven and awkward for traveling across, with small meteorite holes covering 
the surface. The holes range from barely noticeable indents to caping holes 
large enough to hide a small man or animal. Everywhere one looks is grey 
bleakness and inhospitable landscape. Shrapnel from blows to the Perimeter 
litters the area, long shards of metal still standing and providing some scanty 
protection.

Nearing a Gate in the Wall~
   The dusty moonscape stretches out in all directions. Craters of various 
sizes pockmark the otherwise generally level ground. Chunks of melted rock 
ring some of the larger craters. The dry, loose lunar dust bears a 
criss-crossing network of tracks, mute testament to others progress through the 
area. The pervasive impact sites of extra-lunar material split some of the 
trails. The forty-foot-tall Perimeter is mostly still standing, having been 
partially patched, but there are still portions for a savvy predator to slip 
through.

The Eastern Gate~
   This road is not paved in the slightest; it is dirt, packed hard by the 
passing of thousands of feet over the span of several years. On either side of 
the road there is not much to see - looser dirt, rocks, craters, cracks, and 
weeds make up the entirety of the view until the ground eventually disappears 
beyond the horizon. 
   To the west stands massive gates, the Perimeter, and beyond that, Rust. To 
the south stretches Crater Lake, the toxic sludge disappearing into the 
distance. 
   To pass through the gate, you can #6CALL GATEGUARD#0.

A Dirt Road Alongside Crater Lake~
   The purplish-gray sky looms overhead, offering no respite to 
this monotonous road. Hard packed dirt leads onwards as a 
noticeable road, plunging paste the featureless plains to the 
distance beyond. Every now and then a scraggly weed can be seen 
on the edge of the road, fighting for a meager existence. Even 
rarer is noticed a form of critter - small beetles that dark back 
and forth over the hard road. 
   Crater Lake lies to the south of the road, the toxic gray 
sludge disappearing into a gray haze near the horizon.

that little the plains is gray - even the few weeds that manage 
to break through the unfertile soil are gray. The sky overhead 
offers no respite; it is a deep purple above, but fades to gray 
once it gets to the horizon. 
   To the north stands a seven-foot-high, once-ornate stone wall, 
and the road turns in accordance to the grafitti-covered thing.

A Makeshift Bridge Across a Rip~
   Hard-packed dirt marches a mostly-straight road across the 
otherwise loose dirt of the moon plains. The purplish-gray sky 
looms overhead, offering no respite to this monotonous road. 
Small rocks are strewn haphazardly over the road, but offer no 
real challenge to travel. Every so often a weed lies on the 
road, crushed into the dirt by some passing foot. 
   To the west stretches the toxic Crater Lake, vast almost 
beyond comprehension.

A Settlement in the Distance~
   Hard, packed dirt leads onwards as a noticeable road, plunging 
paste the featureless plains to the distance beyond. Small rocks 
are strewn haphazardly over the road, but offer no real challenge 
to travel. Gray invades all colors here, offering nothing at all 
the break the endless monotony. The purlish sky is even infected 
by that gray - the edges of the horizon bear the color dully. 
   To the west stretches the toxic Crater Lake, vast almost 
beyond comprehension.

Nearing a Small Settlement~
   Monotonous gray makes up the entirety of this area's color 
palette. The hard dirt that makes the road is gray, the loose 
dirt that makes up the plains is gray, the boulders and craters 
that little the plains is gray - even the few weeds that manage 
to break through the unfertile soil are gray. The sky overhead 
offers no respite; it is a deep purple above, but fades to gray 
once it gets to the horizon. 
   To the west stretches the toxic Crater Lake, vast almost 
beyond comprehension.

A Narrow, Musty Stairway~
   The air hangs stale and musty in this concrete stairway. It 
is narrowly-built, a man's breadth across. It is obvious there 
has been little traffic here in recent times, and has not been 
maintained; spidery cracks have begun to creep up the stairs; a 
dull green algae collects in the numerous crevices; the small 
light fixtures on the walls have ceased to give light. The 
stairway continues deeper into the ground, and the air grows 
thicker and staler further and further down.

A Crumbling, Narrow Corridor~
   The stairway opens up into an equally narrow corridor. The 
structure itself appears to be compromised; visible cracks run 
along the ceiling and walls, and bits and pieces of rock dot the 
floor. Apparently tunneled by machines, the going is fairy level 
and the ceiling is cut low. The tallest of humans may need to 
duck to traverse this corridor. Thick metal rusted piping runs 
overhead on the cracked ceiling.

A Rubble-Strewn, Caved-In Corridor~
   The concrete passageway comes to a sudden end by a cave-in. 
The ceiling has completely collapsed in on itself and thick 
pieces of concrete cut off further passage to the east. A small 
murky puddle accumulates near the collapsed ceiling, fed by a 
slow steady drip of water from broken ceiling piping. Fine veiny 
algae grows in thick patches here and there on the rubble, 
glistening green under light.

A Damp, Simple Bunkroom~
   This bunkroom is cramped and utilitarian. There is little in 
the way of furniture; two bunk beds are set on the eastern and 
western wall, and a small round table flanked by chairs are 
arranged in the center. Even here, the air is as musty and stale 
as ever. A fine veiny algae films the bed sheets and walls, 
glistening green under light. A rusted blast door is installed 
in the southern wall.

A Derelict, Operations Room~
   As though the inhabitants have merely moved on, this 
operations room stands ravaged by time and abuse. All of the 
walls are set with computers and rusted machinery, and a bolted 
down metal work-desk sits off to the side of the western wall. 
What nature can claim, it has claimed -- a veiny green algae 
creeps all along the computers, machinery, the edges of the 
work-desk, the cracked corners, everywhere. A rusted blast door 
is installed in the northern wall.

A Dank, Nearly-Buried Storeroom~
   Nearly buried under rock, this boxy storeroom is barely 
traversable. A good half of the ceiling has crumbled in so that 
the rubble-strewn floor is sloping and unlevel. The dank 
pervasive smell of rot hangs heavily in the air. Once neat 
wall-shelves have been broken and bent by the rubble, and its 
contents - numerous jars and crates of varying material, food, 
water, tools - lie buried, worn, or shattered. A bent-in blast 
door, held ajar on its hinges, leads back out.

A Wooded, Dense Undergrowth ~
   Nature has a particularly strong grip on this part of the 
woods. Shrubs with spidery leaves run rampant through out the 
hilly area, entangling and obscuring the forest floor, and it 
shines with its own lush green beauty under sunlight. The 
tallest of the undergrowth rises up to knee-height, and makes 
passage across relatively difficult. Curiously below a crooked 
thin willow, on a rocky elevation, the undergrowth relents - the 
shrubbery does not grow as thick on the rock. A dull glint - 
such as that off metal, perhaps - is occasionally seen beneath 
the less-dense undergrowth.

Before A Ravine, A Long Cave Tunnel~
A deep ravine is visible in the center of this tunnel, leading
down into a pit of darkness. An aluminum ladder is attached to 
the base of a large rock, providing passage below for those
brave enough to venture forth. Small fungi and brown moss cover
the rocky walls surrounding you. The tunnel continues to the 
north and east.

A Narrow Ledge, Inside the Ravine~
A narrow ledge overlooking a deep ravine. Shallow pools of murky black
water dot the rocky floor of the ledge, apparently formed by water 
dripping down from long stalactites hanging from above. Small outcrops
of rock extend out from one cave wall, with deposits of a veiny green
algae visible along the cracks and crevices. A rickety, rusting access
ladder has been attached to the side of the ravine opening, precariously
leading upwards while a narrow tunnel is located to the south.

Fluorescent minerals embedded into the rocky walls illuminate this
dank tunnel. Long stalactites reach down from the ceiling high above,
looking as if about to topple down on an unsuspecting victim. Small
fungi have made their home within small nooks and crannies visible 
upon the rocky ground. A narrow passageway is visible to the north,
and the tunnel continues to the south.

An Abandoned Mineshaft~
Long stalactites reach down from the ceiling high above, looking
as if about to topple down on an unsuspecting victim. The air is
musty and damp, and a misty haze is just visible in the dim
lighting. The ground is soft and covered with a sticky residue 
where small fungi have made their home within small nooks and 
crannies, while the walls are dotted with iron deposits of 
varying sizes. Wide, horizontal indentures within the walls
houses both a thick bundle of black, rubber-coated cables and a
series of large, rusted pipes, though numerous sections of it 
have fallen into a state of disrepair.

perfectly designed to infiltrate a boot. The dust is thick 
enough that more than a few of these rocks are camouflaged until 
kicked.

   The dusty moonscape stretches out in all directions. Craters

Chunks of melted rock ring some of the larger craters. The dry, 
loose lunar dust bears a criss-crossing network of tracks, mute 
testament to others progress through the area. The pervasive 
impact sites of extra-lunar material split some of the trails. 
   Tall, verticle cliff-faces jut abruptly out of the ground to 
the east, making passage impossible.

Moon Plains~
   Anything attempting to eek out a meager existence among the 
plains of the moon has its work cut out for it. The ground is 
covered by naught living but the hardiest of weeds - even the 
sight of bugs or other critters is rare. The dust-covered ground 
is littered with rocks and craters, dotting the area here and 
there and everywhere.

Moon Plains~
   This area of walk seems lifeless and barren. Everywhere one 
might step is uneven and awkward for traveling across, with small 
meteorite holes covering the surface. The holes range from 
barely noticeable indents to caping holes large enough to hide a 
small man or animal. Everywhere one looks is grey bleakness and 
inhospitable landscape.

bows downwards, some of the ground cracked and baked even more by something 
that probably wasn't the sun. A number of craters appear to have been flashed 
as they were.

The Crumbling, Walled Perimeter Around a Cathedral~
   These rock-covered grounds that surround the gargantuan 
cathedral once posed, perhaps, as a small village. The houses 
were carved of stone and arranged neatly, allowing the easy flow 
of traffic. That was a long time ago, however - now the majority 
of the houses are collapsed, and the few than remain are little 
more than husks. Pockmarks dot the moonscape here, and an 
occasional hole can be seen ripping through a house or its 
remains, hinting of an old meteor shower than tore the village 
apart, but left the cathedral. Southwards stands a crumbling 
wall, cutting the grounds off from the moon plains that spread 
out to the south.

entrance to the yards around the ancient cathedral, nearly

A Narrow Pounded Path~
   Starting at no location in particular, this pathway appears 
out of nowhere - it opens like a delta, the beginning a large V 
shape, where long ago a multitude of people came from different 
areas and found a common path. Made from moonrock worn flat, it 
cuts directly to the east, uninterrupted. Off in the distance, 
rising high off of the faceless terrain, is an ancient, 
four-towered cathedral, three of those towers capped with 
crosses, the fourth crumbling.

   Crumbling, graffiti-covered walls carved from gray moonrock 
flank this path that cuts a perfect line east and west, worn down 
from ages of use. Far to the west one can just barely make out 
the high walls of Grungetown's Perimeter, while to the east a 
large set of once-ornate stairs lead to a massive cathedral, its 
four towers resembling claws that tear at the sky above.

been considered elaborate, but time has taken its toll. The

cases, the stairs themselves - have been coated in all manner of 
graffiti, from slogans to gang signs, coated so thick that all 
are illegible.

The Crumbling, Walled Perimeter Around a Cathedral~
   These rock-covered grounds that surround the gargantuan 
cathedral once posed, perhaps, as a small village. The houses 
were carved of stone and arranged neatly, allowing the easy flow 
of traffic. That was a long time ago, however - now the majority 
of the houses are collapsed, and the few than remain are little 
more than husks. Pockmarks dot the moonscape here, and an 
occasional hole can be seen ripping through a house or its 
remains, hinting of an old meteor shower than tore the village 
apart, but left the cathedral. Northwards stands a crumbling 
wall, cutting the grounds off from the mountain range that 
spreads to the north.

A Massive, Debased Stone Cathedral~
   Time has taken all resplendence from this mighty monument, 
leaving nothing but intimidation and forboding in its place. 
Four claw-like towers stretch upwards from the rock below, 
reaching impossibly high. The decor and religious carvings that 
once covered the towers have been eroded, their sorry state 
giving the illusion of scales, adding to the claw-like visual of 
the towers. Three of them are capped with slate-gray crosses, 
and the fourth has long-since broken off - the massive symbol 
lies a hundred yards behind the cathedral, shattered, in a crater 
caused by its fall. The large stone doors are flanked on all 
sides by twelve carvings of what were once perhaps people. Now 
they stand anomalous - eyeless faces staring at approaching 
newcomers. Upon inspection, one would notice two things: that 
the entire cathedral and everything on it is carved from the same 
stone, a single mountain turned into this once-great site - and 
the death-like, encompassing silence.

Behind a Desecrated Cathedral~
   These rock-covered grounds that surround the gargantuan 
cathedral once posed, perhaps, as a small village. The houses 
were carved of stone and arranged neatly, allowing the easy flow 
of traffic. That was a long time ago, however - now the majority

occasional hole can be seen ripping through a house or its 
remains, hinting of an old meteor shower than tore the village 
apart, but left the cathedral. A massive stone cross crushes 
many houses here, fallen from one of the cathedral's four towers. 
Debris spreads out in all directions around it, those hunks of 
stone having caused damage wherever they landed.

A Pillared Corridor, Wide and Long~
   This wide, high-roofed corridor stretches into the cathedral. 
Mighty stone pillars hold the roof up, cracked but intact. Once 
upon a time there were images carved into the roof, and 
stainglass in the windows, but that time has long-since passed - 
the carvings have been weathered away or otherwise scratched off, 
and every window has been shattered, the glass turned into 
multicolored dust. Otherwise the corridor is bare, save for the 
layer-upon-layer of grafitti. 
   A spiral set of stairs is hacked into the northern wall, 
leading somewhere above.

A Bell-less Belfry~
   Situated in the middle of the four towers of the cathedral, 
and nowhere near as tall, this belfry is pretty useless as a 
belfry, as there is a distinct lack of bell. Other than that, it 
is pretty featureless - the stone stairs lead to a stone floor, 
the domed roof is supported by four pillars and no windows, and 
it provides a good view of the area around, sans the areas 
blocked by the cathedral's towers.

An Ancient, Desecrated Sanctuary~
   Cracked stone pews line the main aisle, arranged 
symmetrically, and at a slant that would ease the flow of human 
traffic. However, there is none of that here. Abandoned ages 
ago, nothing occupies this sanctuary but dust, silence, and 
layers of grafitti. Curses, swears, gang signs, and a whole list 
of different people who were apparently here decorate this 
once-holy site, painted right over the few remaining holy relics 
- namely three stone crosses that once stood behind the 
graphically-decorated altar. Of those three crosses only the far 
right one remains intact; the left cross has had one arm broken 
off, and someone has cracked the middle cross from its 
foundation, flipped it over, and leaned it back against the wall. 
   Above the altar and crosses, done large enough and recently 
enough to blot out decades of grafitti, someone has undergone the 
painstaking process of incribing the words: #1"I am he that 
liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; 
and have the keys of hell and of death." - Rev. 1:18#0. The 
writing is in blood.

The Plains of the Moon~
   The dusty moonscape stretches out in all directions. Craters 
of various sizes pockmark the otherwise generally level ground. 
Chunks of melted rock ring some of the larger craters. The dry, 
loose lunar dust bears a criss-crossing network of tracks, mute 
testament to others progress through the area. The pervasive 
impact sites of extra-lunar material split some of the trails.

The Plains of the Moon~
   The desolate landscape stretches out towards some distant 
hills on the horizon where the land meets with some ragged cliffs 
and high ground. The relatively flat plains here, though, are 
pock marked with craters and some ravines, making the going 
difficult despite the mostly level nature of the ground. 


   A small shaft has been dug here, half concealed, slipping down 
beneath the surface. A flush titon door has been set off several 
meters to the west of it.

progress in this empty place is dirt, as there is a ton of it.

The Plains of the Moon~
   The desolate landscape stretches out towards some distant 
hills on the horizon where the land meets with some ragged cliffs 
and high ground. The relatively flat plains here, though, are 
pock marked with craters and some ravines, making the going 
difficult despite the mostly level nature of the ground.

Old, Suburban Ruins~
   At one point these ruins perhaps proved to be a popular 
lakeside residence - a suburb of sorts, lining the lakeshore and 
sprawling out a ways into the plains, and even further to the 
west. Now, though, barely any of the surburb remains; no more 
than ten houses remain standing, with the rest caved into 
themselves or otherwise knocked over. The ruins continue to the 
west, and Crater Lake stretches off to the south, the opposite 
shoreline not even visible from this standpoint.

The Plains of the Moon~
   This area of walk seems lifeless and barren. Everywhere one 
might step is uneven and awkward for traveling across, with small 
meteorite holes covering the surface. The holes range from 
barely noticeable indents to caping holes large enough to hide a 
small man or animal. Everywhere one looks is grey bleakness and 
inhospitable landscape.

Bordering A Ruined Settlement~
   At one point these ruins perhaps proved to be a medium-sized 
settlement - a patch of houses sprawling out a ways into the 
plains to the north and south, and the gutted hulks of an 
industrial complex remains to the west. Now, though, barely any 
of the surburbs remain; no more than ten houses remain standing, 
with the rest caved into themselves or otherwise knocked over. 
The industrial complex faired no better: ruined, desolate, 
crumbling into the formless, shapeless gray of the plains.

Thinning, Desolate Ruins~
   Whatever these ruins might have once been they are not that, 
now. A few houses dot the landscape, but most are little more 
than a heap of debris, and some aren't even that - blocks of 
foundation can be found frequently, some cracked into pieces. A 
few scraggly weeds poke up between the rubble, but nothing 
substantial seems to be able to take hold.

The Plains of the Moon~
   The monochromatic terrain convulsed upon itself at some point, 
wrenching into a series of rolling hills with gentle slopes. 
Fractured by craters and gulleys, hills like these rise up on the 
borders of a lunar plane. Gray dust has coated the hills, 
rounding the rough edges of the rocks beneath.

The Plains of the Moon~
   These plains are an ocean of gray dirt, broken every so often 
by rocks and craters. Weeds cling desperately to life and seem 
to generally be failing - the scraggly things are withered and 
broken. The only thing that seems to be making any cort of 
progress in this empty place is dirt, as there is a ton of it. 
It lies fairly loose atop the rock, and puffs up whenever stepped 
on.

The Plains of the Moon~
   Anything attempting to eek out a meager existence among the 
plains of the moon has its work cut out for it. The ground is 
covered by naught living but the hardiest of weeds - even the 
sight of bugs or other critters is rare. The dust-covered ground 
is littered with rocks and craters, dotting the area here and 
there and everywhere.

blocks of foundation can be found frequently, some cracked into

nothing substantial seems to be able to take hold among the 
twisted, wrecked metal and stone. 
   A concrete building sits just to the west, and remains intact.

A Collapsed Building and Metal Hatch~
   The one-time industrial complex dead-ends here at the large 
remains of a gray building, three of its walls fallen away to 
leave only one westward facing wall standing, a great hatch set 
into the concrete floor before it. The ground slopes toward it, 
paved, tread tracks cut shallowly into the surface of the cement. 
To the far east, some housing is visible. To the north, the 
gutted industrial ruins remain.

The Plains of the Moon~
   Dirty, dry, and barren, these plains are about as empty as it 
gets. The only features worthy of any note are the various 
boulders and weeds that little the ground, almost breaking the 
monotony of this wasteland. It stretches onwards and outwards, 
near infinite.

The Plains of the Moon~
   Dry and barren, the land here is rough. Grey dust gets kicked 
up by passersby who try to traverse the rocky plains. The rocks 
are of various sizes, from house-sized boulders to pebbles 
perfectly designed to infiltrate a boot. The dust is thick 
enough that more than a few of these rocks are camouflaged until 
kicked.

The Plains of the Moon~
   The monochromatic terrain convulsed upon itself at some point, 
wrenching into a series of rolling hills with gentle slopes. 
Fractured by craters and gulleys, hills like these rise up on the 
borders of a lunar plane. Gray dust has coated the hills, 
rounding the rough edges of the rocks beneath.

The Ruins of Some Sort of Facility~
   This place was once a facility of some sort, a handful of 
buildings serving as some sort of utility to the massive windmill 
that looms to the north. Now, however, is not then - years have 
passed, and this facility has been looted, burned, and run down. 
Whatever walls that still stand are torn and eroded, less, even, 
than shadows of whatever they used to be.

   The dusty moonscape stretches out in all directions. Craters 
of various sizes pockmark the otherwise generally level ground. 
Chunks of melted rock ring some of the larger craters. The dry, 
loose lunar dust bears a criss-crossing network of tracks, mute 
testament to others progress through the area. The pervasive 
impact sites of extra-lunar material split some of the trails.

   These plains are an ocean of gray dirt, broken every so often 
by rocks and craters. Weeds cling desperately to life and seem 
to generally be failing - the scraggly things are withered and 
broken. The only thing that seems to be making any cort of 
progress in this empty place is dirt, as there is a ton of it. 
It lies fairly loose atop the rock, and puffs up whenever stepped 
on.

Plains Alongside a Road~
   Dirty, dry, and barren, these plains are about as empty as it 
gets. The only features worthy of any note are the various 
boulders and weeds that little the ground, almost breaking the 
monotony of this wasteland. It stretches onwards and outwards, 
near infinite.

Plains Alongside a Road~
   These plains are an ocean of gray dirt, broken every so often 
by rocks and craters. Weeds cling desperately to life and seem 
to generally be failing - the scraggly things are withered and 
broken. The only thing that seems to be making any cort of 
progress in this empty place is dirt, as there is a ton of it. 
It lies fairly loose atop the rock, and puffs up whenever stepped 
on.

Everywhere one might step is uneven and awkward for traveling 
across, with small meteorite holes covering the surface. The 
dust is thick here, exploding out a thick powdery mist whenever 
stepped on. Dirty, dry, and barren, these plains are about as

   This area of walk seems lifeless and barren. Everywhere one 
might step is uneven and awkward for traveling across, with small 
meteorite holes covering the surface. The holes range from 
barely noticeable indents to caping holes large enough to hide a 
small man or animal. Everywhere one looks is grey bleakness and 
inhospitable landscape.

The Plains of the Moon~
   The dusty moonscape stretches out in all directions. Craters 
of various sizes pockmark the otherwise generally level ground. 
Chunks of melted rock ring some of the larger craters. The dry, 
loose lunar dust bears a criss-crossing network of tracks, mute 
testament to others progress through the area. The pervasive 
impact sites of extra-lunar material split some of the trails.

metal debris and other scraps visible, and some sparse fungus is

the road turns sharply, toward a paved concrete field to the 
south, and the further south it goes the less and less preserved 
it appears to be - cracks appear, parts of it have been shifted 
and resettled elsewhere, or are outright missing.

middle of this area. For all the ruin around it, this large 
field is startling in both its condition (it is, if not pristine, 
at least undemolished) and its uniformity - unbroken gray.

Outside A Ruined Apartment Building~
   A pocked and crumbled roadway leads up here to a wide concrete 
patio, steps up from there to the double doors of an old 
apartment building, now derelict. The building stands about four 
stories, its structure still largely intact. Crumbled walls 
surround this patio courtyard, corralling in mounds of rubble and 
debris which have been dumped by previous scavengers departing 
the structure.

The Gutted Hollow of a Collapsed Building~
   The remains of this building create a sort of windbreaker, and 
part of a roof provides some shelter from any adverse weather. 
The wall and partial ceiling are made from concrete, and the 
debris that clutters the area is also concrete - part of a 
remaining northern wall extends a short distance from the 
building, about knee high. The rest of the area looks to have 
been demolished violently in the past and now sits, almost 
unchanged from that initial violence, slowly collapsing onto 
itself.

Descending Into a Crater, Flush Against the Wall~
   This path that zigzags down into the crater is, at best, 
incredibly dangerous. It is wide enough for one person to walk 
along, pressed flat up against the crater wall. The side of the 
crater is smooth enough to not hinder the process of descending 
or ascending, but rough enough to remind anyone that it is not a 
pleasant trip. Beneath the path crumbles away occasionally, just 
to add a mite of terror to anyone traveling.

taller wall to the north, forming the back end of a partially 
collapsed building on the lip of this barren cliff-face. The 
rest of this area remains open, and a large crater can be seen 
stretching out to the southwest, making further travel in that 
direction unadvisable.

   The roof and most of the walls of this building have

provide some shelter from bad weather. The area around the 
partially collapsed building is curiously free of clutter, save 
for some rocky rubble along the southern, knee-high wall and 
chunks of metal debris, and silt piles up on the inside of this 
room, creating small dunes.

To the north it seems to dead-end but is in relatively good

Dead End in a Broken Perimeter Road~
   The road the forms the perimeter of the ruins to the south 
ends abruptly here, buried beneath a high wall of trash to the 
north. Otherwise, the road is in surprisingly good repair, the 
black asphault running north and south.

The Plains of the Moon~
   Anything attempting to eek out a meager existence among the 
plains of the moon has its work cut out for it. The ground is 
covered by naught living but the hardiest of weeds - even the 
sight of bugs or other critters is rare. The dust-covered ground 
is littered with rocks and craters, dotting the area here and 
there and everywhere.

Along a Broken Perimeter Road~
   This road runs along the edge of what appears to have once 
been several buildings, and are now just ruins and rubble. Here 
the road turns to the south, looking in considerably worse 
condition the further it runs. It is warped and sits oddly, as 
if the ground below it had been moved explosively in the past.

End of a Ruined Perimeter Road~
   This road runs along the edge of what appears to have once 
been several buildings, and are now just ruins and rubble. It 
dead-ends here, while it continues to run - in poor condition - 
to the northeast. Debris chokes this end of the road, and the 
road itself is cracking and in large pieces.

A Debris-Choked Field Before a Crater~
   A perimeter road starts to the north and runs along the ruined 
buildings to the east. Here, however, there is no road - there 
is only an uneven, debris-cluttered field before the crater 
opening up to the south, its rocky ground leading straight to the 
edge. Most of the debris is just useless rubble: concrete, 
twisted hunks of cracking plastic, or old metal rebar, rusted 
beyond useability.

The Plains of the Moon~
   These plains are an ocean of gray dirt, broken every so often 
by rocks and craters. Weeds cling desperately to life and seem 
to generally be failing - the scraggly things are withered and 
broken. The only thing that seems to be making any cort of 
progress in this empty place is dirt, as there is a ton of it. 
It lies fairly loose atop the rock, and puffs up whenever stepped 
on.

   The monochromatic terrain convulsed upon itself at some point,

rounding the rough edges of the rocks beneath.

The Inside of a Run-Down Facility~
   Lightless, dusty, and old, this facility is long past its 
prime. The concrete walls are bare and cracked, and the entire 
room is completely empty - it was looted long ago. Scorched 
sections of the room show where someone has even tried to burn 
the place down multiple times, but fortunately enough for the 
emptied husk concrete is less than flammable. Along the west 
wall there is an inscription, done in blood or red paint - a 
series of numbers and symbols that runs the entire length of the 
wall.

A Ruined, Looted Facility~
   This building is little more than a concrete husk, with 
everything - even things once bolted down - removed. Scorch 
marks marr the concrete here and there, ugly black splotches on 
the ugly gray concrete. Above can be heard low metallic groans 
from the flimsy-yet-massive windmill that is built atop this 
building. Along the western wall is scrawled a crude message. 
To the south it is mostly symbols and numbers, but as it gets 
closer to the northern wall it converges to a single point, the 
five lines turning into a very neat cursive, written in deep red. 
It reads: "#1Come ride with me, through the veins of history. 
I'll show you a God who falls asleep on the job.#0"

The Plains of the Moon~
   The monochromatic terrain convulsed upon itself at some point, 
wrenching into a series of rolling hills with gentle slopes. 
Fractured by craters and gulleys, hills like these rise up on the 
borders of a lunar plane. Gray dust has coated the hills, 
rounding the rough edges of the rocks beneath.

Ruins Surrounding a Windmill~
   This place was once a facility of some sort, a handful of 
buildings serving as some sort of utility to the massive windmill 
that looms to the east. Now, however, is not then - years have 
passed, and this facility has been looted, burned, and run down. 
Whatever walls that still stand are torn and eroded, less, even, 
than shadows of whatever they used to be.

The Plains of the Moon~
   These plains are an ocean of gray dirt, broken every so often 
by rocks and craters. Weeds cling desperately to life and seem 
to generally be failing - the scraggly things are withered and 
broken. The only thing that seems to be making any cort of 
progress in this empty place is dirt, as there is a ton of it. 
It lies fairly loose atop the rock, and puffs up whenever stepped 
on.

The Plains Run Alongside a Road~
   Dirty, dry, and barren, these plains are about as empty as it 
gets. The only features worthy of any note are the various 
boulders and weeds that little the ground, almost breaking the 
monotony of this wasteland. It stretches onwards and outwards, 
near infinite.

Before a Ruined Hospital~
   A row of statues flanks the entrance to the shattered glass 
doors of this hospital, standing all in a neat row. They are 
carved of stone and are, for the most part, destroyed. Heads are 
missing, and arms - in some places the statues are missing 
entirely. Out of the fifty or so statues, though, there is often 
an intact one - it is #5a jowly, portly british man,#0 posed with 
one arm by his side, and the other half-cocked, holding up two 
fingers. He is smiling, with a big fat stogey clamped between 
his teeth.

The Plains of the Moon~
   These plains are an ocean of gray dirt, broken every so often 
by rocks and craters. Weeds cling desperately to life and seem 
to generally be failing - the scraggly things are withered and 
broken. The only thing that seems to be making any cort of 
progress in this empty place is dirt, as there is a ton of it. 
It lies fairly loose atop the rock, and puffs up whenever stepped 
on.

up by passersby who try to traverse the rocky plains. The rocks 
are of various sizes, from house-sized boulders to pebbles 
perfectly designed to infiltrate a boot. The dust is thick 
enough that more than a few of these rocks are camouflaged until 
kicked.

   Rising to the north is a sheer wall of rough, natural stone

celestial body. A steep pathway cuts in a switchback trail up 
the escarpment, its destination not visible from the trailhead

Inside a Ruined Hospital~
   The lobby of this hospital is long-since ransacked. Stone 
grit, old stains, and unindentifiable debris covers the floor, 
and around the doors and windows are pieces of glass both large 
and small. A u-shaped desk is directly west from the doors, and 
that is as far as one can get into the large building. Debris 
and half-collapsed roofs clog the entrance to any other part of 
this hospital. What used to be the second floor is now a large 
wall just behind the desk. It is plausible that there might 
still be stuff of use in the hospital, but more than a little 
digging would have to be done to find it.

The Plains of the Moon~
   This area of walk seems lifeless and barren. Everywhere one 
might step is uneven and awkward for traveling across, with small 
meteorite holes covering the surface. The holes range from 
barely noticeable indents to caping holes large enough to hide a 
small man or animal. Everywhere one looks is grey bleakness and 
inhospitable landscape.

The Plains of the Moon~
   Anything attempting to eek out a meager existence among the 
plains of the moon has its work cut out for it. The ground is 
covered by naught living but the hardiest of weeds - even the 
sight of bugs or other critters is rare. The dust-covered ground 
is littered with rocks and craters, dotting the area here and 
there and everywhere.

A Demolished Road Leading to a Hospital~
   Where this road begins is subject to debate, as a ways out to 
the east it just sort of appears - the dust and rocks and craters 
that cover it are to blame for this, and it is entirely possible 
that the road has been so demolished further on that it has 
ceased to exist. Here, however, it can just be made out. Chunks 
of asphault rise up out of the dust at odd angles, providing more 
of a hindrance to movement than was perhaps the original 
intention. The road continues to the west, right up to the 
hospital doors. Closer to the building are statues, flanking 
this road.

A Broad, Flat Plateau~
   Flat, crunchy ground extends in almost all directions here, 
finely-ground, porous gravel shifting under each footfall. Odd 
furrows in the gravel run parallel across the ground from a wide 
gully to the north, fanning out to the east and south here. To 
the west rises upheaved stone, even grey in color, blocking 
progress in that direction. A tall, rounded mount of stone 
perhaps twenty feet high at its highest point lies off to the 
northeast, the top of a single skyscraper still visible far in 
the distance beyond it.

Remains of a Rockslide~
   A twenty foot rise of stone extends off to the northeast, huge 
chunks each larger than a man scattered in all directions like 
fallen leaves. Between the standing stones is only the loose 
footing of porous gravel, extending across the broad, flat 
section of plateau. On the escarpment to the east can be seen 
even drill holes in the rock. Scorchmarks cascade across the 
flat stone to the east like emanating waves, making patterns that 
fool the eye with the illusion of motion when seen askance.

A Broad, Flat Plateau~
   Flat, crunchy ground extends in almost all directions here, 
finely-ground, porous gravel shifting under each footfall. The 
plateau is flat and even except for odd furrows in the gravel, 
extending a considerable distance both north and west. To the 
east is a sheer expanse of stone extending both north and south, 
chips and marring from many bullets and the scorching of 
explosive blasts clearly visible on its uncracked surface. 
Solid, upheaved stone blocks any view to the south from here.

   Flat, crunchy ground extends in almost all directions here, 
finely-ground, porous gravel shifting under each footfall. The 
plateau is flat and even except for odd furrows in the gravel, 
extending a considerable distance both north and east. The 
desiccated carcass of a massive, treaded mining robot, long since 
stripped of all useful parts, lies ominously to the side. To the 
northwest, jagged rocks of stone have been pushed up from below 
to higher than a man's head, leaving only a narrow ledge for 
passage to the west along an unmitigated drop to the plains 
below. Solid, upheaved stone blocks any view to the south from 
here, jagged spires sticking upright like the fingers on a 
splayed hand. Over the rocks far to the northeast tall 
skyscrapers can be seen of a long derelict cityscape, some 
toppled at odd angles.

A Narrow Ledge~
   Flat, crunchy ground extends east and west here, 
finely-ground, porous gravel shifting under each footfall, 
threatening to slide off the precipice to the south. Only a few 
low rocks mark the top of the sheer drop to the south where a 
colliding celestial body has cloven the earth. Beyond the 
precipice a ruin can be seen on the moonplain to the southwest, a 
massive building, dark and ominous. To the north, jagged rocks 
of stone have been pushed up from below to higher than a man's 
head, blocking progress across the plateau. Over the rocks to 
the northeast tall skyscrapers can be seen of a long derelict 
cityscape, some toppled at odd angles.

A Rock-Shrouded Alcove~
   Flat, crunchy ground extends to the south here, finely-ground, 
porous gravel shifting under each footfall. A single spire of 
dark-colored stone juts upward like a crooked finger pointing to 
the Earth in the sky above. On all other sides, jagged rocks of 
stone have been pushed up from below to higher than a man's head, 
blocking progress across the plateau. Over the rocks to the 
northeast tall skyscrapers can be seen of a long derelict 
cityscape, some toppled at odd angles.

A Swath of Plateau~
   Flat, crunchy ground extends to the north and east here, 
finely-ground, porous gravel shifting under each footfall. 
Individual large boulders of grey unremarkable rock are scattered 
about, tossed by some great upheaval. To the west rises jagged 
rocks of stone pushed up from below, blocking progress in that 
direction. Over the rocks to the northeast tall skyscrapers can 
be seen of a long derelict cityscape, some toppled at odd angles.

Atop a Switchback Trail~
   Jagged rocks pushed up at the edge of a long crater-like 
trough fill this area like teeth in a gaping maw. To the south 
is a sharp drop to the moonplains below, ruins of a large 
building visible beyond. A switchback trail leads down the 
escarpment, cutting tenuously upwards to this vantage. To the 
north extends a flat and level plateau, jagged rises of stone 
blocking the view beyond.

A Derelict Utility Corridor~
   Once part of a hallway under the factory allowing the routing 
of wiring and cables, this is now a squarish space filled with 
ruined crates and torn-up infrastructure mountings. The gutted 
housing of a generation core looms along the south wall, its 
fractured grate looking like a disturbing smile, a pair of 
sinister eyes spray-painted above it. The tunnel eastward has 
been filled by collapsed stone, a tough climb up to the factory 
floor above. The tunnel extends westward, enclosed and slightly 
dank.

A Refuse-Strewn Corner of a Derelict Factory~
   Two walls and a roof still remain here, making this a 
sheltered alcove amidst the ruin. Remains of fires scorch the 
stone floor and bits of trash and refuse mound against the walls, 
evidence of recent habitation by some form of human or mutant 
life. The concrete floor drops off to the south, the metal floor 
panels that once covered a utility room below having been 
scavenged at some point, leaving it exposed.

The Collapsed Entrance to a Mine~
   Cast concrete framings, molded with precision-molded curves 
with ancient technology, once supported a massive tunnel entrance 
here. They have been sundered in half, collapsing into the mine 
shaft and the stone falling in on top of them. A breeze of stale 
air still blows from the gaping, stone-clogged maw, but no 
passage is discernable. A partial roof still remains over this 
portion of the factory floor, extending to the west.

   The factory floor here has collapsed into a passage below, 
slabs of concrete askew at all angles and chunks of rock filling 
the gaps. Beams of an old conveyor system string above in a 
network of pylons and supports, the mechanisms stripped and 
removed. A portion of the utility tunnel to the west can be 
accessed by climbing down the precarious rubble.

   Cast-offs from the gutting of this spartan factory have been 
mounded here, everything not taken in the original looting broken 
and heaped. The floor here is shattered by harsh blows, 
splintering upward, but not ruptured. The back wall of the 
factory is obliterated here to the north, the mounds of rubbish 
spilling out and partway up the steep stone slope behind.

floor is only interrupted by patterns of cracks which emanate out 
as concentric circles approximately eight feet across, spaced at 
random intervals.

   The concrete footings of a gargantuan crucible lie here, each 
squat cube the size of a modest table. Fittings hang from pylons 
above, showing where the crucible once hung, long since stripped 
and recycled. A conveyor system, its chains removed but the 
pulleys remaining, once helped move things along near the 
collapsed ceiling, now the rotted nests of prior vulture roosting 
filling the crevices.

limbless trees in a decayed forest. The sky and Earth hang 
above, the absent roof giving clear vantage.

   The heavy blocks of collapsed concrete tell the story here; 
once a large archway wide enough for massive mining bots to pass 
side by side, it now simply marks the end of the thick concrete 
wall of an old building. The roof, beams, and other signs of the 
building's structure are long removed, the one standing wall 
stretching from here off to the west. A towering wall of debris 
rises to the east, high overhead. The remains of the building 
interior lie northward.

the cliff looks down onto this featureless expanse. A wall of 
aged concrete can be seen in the north across the plateau.

falling around the troughs and furrows that wend between them. Blood-stains 
coat the rocks, seeping into the gravel sea. A waste-heap of slag and stone 
hunks mounded almost twenty feet high rises to the east blocking progress in 
that direction. Rising in the distance to the northwest is an old, high, 
concrete wall.

A Blood-Spattered Gravel Plateau~
   Pea-sized gravel of porous grey stone covers the ground here 
like a colorless desert. Natural swells and dunes stretch in all 
directions, rising and falling around the troughs and furrows 
that wend between them. Blood-stains coat the rocks, seeping 
into the gravel sea. Jagged, pushed-up slabs of stone prevent 
passage to the south.

A Widening Gully~
   Flat, crunchy gravel fills this gully, shifting under foot 
with each step. A waste-heap of slag and stone hunks mounded 
almost twenty feet high rises to the north and northeast. The 
plateau widens here and opens into a wide, flat plain westward, 
jagged, pushed-up slabs of stone preventing passage to the south.

A Sharp Bend In a Wide Gully~
   Flat, crunchy gravel fills this gully, shifting under foot 
with each step. A waste-heap of slag and stone hunks mounded 
almost twenty feet high rises to the northeast, piling up against 
the slops of a solid stone mount to the southeast. The plateau 
opens into a wide, flat plain westward, jagged, pushed-up slabs 
of stone preventing passage to the southwest.

A Wide Gully~
   Flat, crunchy gravel fills this gully, shifting under foot 
with each step. A solid mount of hard rock rises domed to the 
east while massive slabs of pushed up stone block the west. 
Bullet holes and odd pockmarks of other sorts mar the stone on 
either side, where sunken bolts hold dangling rusty wires from 
old triplines. The scorched and burnt-out hulk of a massive, 
six-legged mining bot emerges from the gravel in the center of 
the path, more than half buried after sinking or being dragged 
under the shifting stones. The gully continues on to the north 
across the broad plateau.

A Dank Utility Tunnel~
   Old, rotted-out piping is bent and contorted unnaturally here, 
warped and destroyed by tremendous force. Plastic crates have 
been smashed, piles of refuse scattered about within the narrow 
concrete tunnel. A door of solid steel seals the western end, 
signs of fire and explosion on the walls around it though the 
door is completely unmarred. An alcove in the south side of the 
tunnel contains a single, round hole about six feet across, the 
mortared, old stone completely unmarred as well. A dank, fetid 
air rises from within, the bottom lost in darkness.

The Floor of a Large Crater~
   The floor of this crater is rough and rocky and slightly 
sloped, all paths leading down to the center. The walls block 
large portions of the purplish-gray of the sky above, obscuring 
the horizons all around. Small rocks litter the ground, none of 
which are larger than a fist. It is nearly a layer of gravel in 
its consistency, covered entirely in moon dust.

   The floor of this crater is rough and rocky and slightly 
sloped, all paths leading down to the center. The walls block 
large portions of the purplish-gray of the sky above, obscuring 
the horizons all around. Small rocks litter the ground, none of 
which are larger than a fist. It is nearly a layer of gravel in 
its consistency, covered entirely in moon dust.

A Plateau Worm Farm~
   This is one of three worm farms set for the plateau region; 
53900, 53901, and 53902. Worms spawn in here from mining and 
then wander out the exits to plateau locations.

   This broad concrete tunnel slopes down into darkness. The 
gray walls, ceiling and coarse gray concrete floor echo 
monotonously into that black, as omnious as they are boring. The 
walls, while once relatively smooth to the touch - 
notwithstanding that coarseness natural to concrete - are now 
pocked and cracked. Dust lies thick on the floor.

A Metal, Spiral Staircase in a Concrete Shaft~
   A metal spiral staircase twists up and down in this 
gray-walled concrete shaft, each step textured and dusty, its 
handrail smoothed and dull. To the west, a concrete step and 
plain door leads out of the stairwell and to somewhere else. 
Otherwise, the monotony is unbroken.

Partially-Collapsed, Concrete Stairwell~
   This concrete stairwell is nothing more than a gray-walled 
shaft in which a spiraling iron staircase had at one point been 
placed. Now, however, the spiraling iron staircase is rusted and 
crumpled, forming a twisted metal knot, and is surrounded by 
concrete debris. As a result, further progress up the stairs is 
impossible from here.

A Refurbished Spiral Staircase~
   Appearing to be recently renovated, this spiral staircase 
curves down from the upper landing, each step evenly spaced with 
the one about it. Showing no sign of wear, the stairs appear to 
be made of metal, and echo a metallic clink with each step upon 
them. A shiny handrail, about a meter and a half raised from the 
level of the stairs with bars supporting it every three steps, 
follows the spiral curve, ensuring the safety of those moving up 
or down the flight.

A Collapsed, Concrete Shaft~
   The metal spiral staircase loses all integrity here, and many 
iron-grated steps are missing. The handrail is entirely gone, 
and only the thick, long metal pole anchoring the staircase to 
the floor and ceiling remains entirely intact. Still, given the 
concrete debris and jagged metal spikes protruding from that 
metal pole, it would be possible to climb up or down if careful, 
or lucky.

The Bottom of a Concrete Shaft~

The metal pole that anchors the spiral staircase in the stairwell 
- visible above - takes up much of the space in this small room; 
chunks of concrete take up the rest, and the room broadens out 
into a concrete tunnel to the west.

Utility Tunnel~
   This utility tunnel runs north and south, shrinking to a

Dead End in Utility Tunnel~
   The utility tunnel here has collapsed in a dead-end, concrete 
rubble filling up and blocking any passage to the west. Wires 
run along the ceiling and thick, knotted metal-sheathed cables 
twist, caught in the cave-in. There wires and cables continue to 
run to the east, where the tunnel runs north and south in a 
straight line.

Utility Tunnel~
   The noisy static buzz grows louder here, and continues to grow 
louder the further south one travels down the utility tunnel. 
Directly to the south, however, there is a catwalk running across 
a narrow, concrete trench - some kind of gutter - and past that 
is the start of a large, square-walled room. Cables and wires 
line the wall of this utility tunnel, many different colours, 
textures and sizes.

Rickety Catwalk Across A Concrete Trench~
   A rickety metal catwalk stretches across what is apparently a 
concrete trench and series of deeper tunnels that lead off, 
severl feet below, to the east and west. The catwalk itself 
bridges the gap between concrete utility tunnels - to the north, 
that branch winds on a ways. To the south, that tunnel opens 
into a large room. A humming can be heard nearby; it echoes 
distantly.

apparent, and a catwalk is visible a few feet up. The walls, 
though crumbled, appear unscaleable. A smaller tunnel runs to 
the northwest, a faint buzzing audible coming from it. To the 
southeast, the rubble clears.

goop that smells strongly acrid.

utility closet that opens up to the west. There is little debris 
in this area - in fact, it is almost conspiciously clean. Other 
than that, however, nothing's really noticeable about this place. 
Faint static humming can be heard; it sounds like it is echoes in 
from the northwest.

Collapsed End in a Utility Tunnel~
   The utility tunnel here has collapsed in a dead-end, concrete 
rubble filling up and blocking any passage to the south. Wires 
run along the ceiling and thick, knotted metal-sheathed cables 
twist, caught in the cave-in. There wires and cables continue to 
run to the north, where the tunnel hooks both east and westward.

Storage Space~
   This utility closet is small, walled in by the same steel and 
concrete as the rest of the factory, and lined on all sides by 
steel shelves, though most now are empty or coated only by dust 
or sticky, unidentifiable mold. A door to the south leads back 
out into a larger, rectangular-shaped room.

Small Kitchen and Break Room~
   This small room opens up from the workspace to the south and 
leads to the north to an elevator shaft beyond a smooth, single 
steel door. The room itself appears to be some sort of kitchen 
and break room - a counter lines one wall, complete with 
nonfunctioning sink, and there are electrical outlets there too, 
though no small electrical appliances that might be normally 
associated with kitchen areas. A metal table has been bolted to 
the floor, chairless.

Elevator Shaft~
   This elevator shaft runs up and down into darkness, utterly 
clear of debris and uniformly gray-walled. There are no real 
handholds visible anywhere along the smooth walls, and what was 
once a service ladder is now an unserviceable heap of twisted, 
rusted scrap metal clinging to a side wall. In fact, if you're 
here right now, it's probably because you're falling.

Bottom of an Elevator Shaft~
   The main pump and an additional safety plank sits here at the 
bottom landing. Toward the very bottom, just to the side of the 
pump, the tail weight is housed and connected to the majority of 
the mechanism itself. The flooring here has a similar grating as 
the top shaft, complete with an operating pit for when a car is 
at the bottom floor.

Elevator Shaft~
   This above section of elevator shaft is grated off by steel 
cross segments. Running through several small openings in the 
grating are cables that have begun to rust from neglect. Close 
to the walls are modular rails with teethed indentions to prevent 
a car from moving too fast in either direction. Beyond the 
pillars run maintenance ladders that share some of the deep 
brownish orange decay, and are missing too many rungs to be at 
all useful.

Cubicle-Divided Office Space~
   This room has been partitioned into cubicle space, each little 
square holding a desk and chair, sometimes dusty old electronics, 
and sometimes only dust. There are perhaps seven such cubicle 
spaces here in this section of the room, which ends in a glossy 
metal elevator door to the north, and hooks southeast in an L 
shape.

Partially-Collapsed, Concrete Stairwell~
   This concrete stairwell is nothing more than a gray-walled 
shaft in which a spiraling iron staircase had at one point been 
placed. Now, however, the spiraling iron staircase is rusted and 
crumpled, forming a twisted metal knot, and is surrounded by 
concrete debris. As a result, further progress down the stairs 
is impossible from here.

   This narrow catwalk is made from concrete and steel, iron 
grating, and stretches across the northern wall here, forming a 
crude balcony over the factory floor. There is a single, flimsy 
plastic and steel guard-rail; it is not so much a deterrent as a

plastic, sliding glass door opens to the north into an office 
space, cubicle-cluttered.

A Twisting Tunnel, Widening to the West~
   This tunnel narrows to the east, where it branches into a 
northern and southern segment, and broadens to the west where it 
rounds out into a large, strange room. The floor of the tunnel 
is uneven, broken slabs of concrete torn up and heaped awkwardly 
across one another, and travel is difficult. The walls are 
gouged out roughly; the machined eveness of the rest of the 
underground factory is lost here: this area feels almost wild, 
and wildly savage.

A Cavernous, Crumbled Room~
   This underground chamber, though at one point artifically 
made, has been improved upon so much in the past that the moniker 
no longer applies; this room feels less like a room at all and 
more like a cave: the ceiling is high and lopsided, sloping 
sharply to the south, the floor is rough and unpaved and in some 
places even rocky, and the far wall is scarred and smeared with 
dry, dead fungus.

Atop a Flat Outlook~
   This is a flat spit of stone, stretching east and west. 
Thick, dry grass blades sprout from the outcrop, like an unkempt 
head of hair on the earth below. A sheer drop lies north and 
south, the stone split along a natural faultline.

Before an Outpost~
   A ring of scrap heap is piled around a towering spire to the 
north, though it appears to be an ineffective barricade. The 
spire looks like some kind of modified turbine, with twisted 
metal jutting out. A single fenced gate, equally twisted and 
ruined, bars the way inside to the outpost. Like a single finger 
pointing into the sky, the metal-gray spire is the only 
noticeable feature that stretches in miles.

Inside a Twisted Metal Spiral~
   It seems remarkable at all that this can be a living space, 
for the walls are barely furnished or even made plain. Some 
metal still sticks out at random angles, threatening to snag 
anyone careless. However this spire appears to be sturdy enough, 
standing the ravages of time. Faded inscriptions of some unknown 
language cascade up the walls in some areas. A scrap-heap ladder 
leads up and up the spire.

On a Rickety, Mechanical Bridge~
   This segmented mechanical bridge is rickety and rusty - a 
dangerous traversing by any means. Some of the platforms appear 
to be almost paper-thin, yet others are with little support. The 
double-railing on either side looks to be weathered beyond any 
real use, serving as a last-ditch support for the bridge. Each 
side of the crater edge to the east and west is within view.

Before the Valley Between Two Ruined Craters~
   Rearing up hundreds of feet in the air are the sloping rock 
walls of the remnants of two craters scarred into the lunar 
surface. The rims of the twin craters are jagged and irregular, 
deeply riven and cracked, having being stripped of much of their 
mass as evidenced by the rubble that covers the ground here. 
Ahead is the entrance into the valley between the pocked pair, a 
narrow mouth of some dozens of yards permitting northern travel. 
Elsewhere the lunar plains stretch on.

Desolation in the Crater Valley~
   The ground here is blanketed with fragments of rock, scraps of 
incinerated, ambiguous matter and, rarely, ruined metal. Given 
form only by the harrowed crater walls lining this valley 
passage, this place is a study in chaos, a littering of random 
elements of creation stripped of identity. Footing here is 
difficult - patches of ground untouched by the sprawl of 
destruction are rare.

   Everywhere in this place the ground is a graveyard of 
disorder, an orderless carpet of fragmented matter, crushed 
beneath scatterings of lunar rubble. Here, in a natural corner 
of the valley, a pile of rock and ruin dozens of feet high and 
wide has been smashed into the crater walls with great force. 
Large gashes suggest the walls have been fired on by a giant's 
shotgun.

   Rising high overhead is the rock wall of the eastern crater 
that forms this valley. Pitted and scarred, much rubble has 
fallen from the wall's face to cover the ground here, though this 
area is clearer than most in the valley. This relative clarity 
permits the viewing of stark shadows seemingly etched into the 
rock wall near to the ground. Several of the shadows, 
human-sized and vaguely human in form, are seared black into the 
rock, part of it.

surrounding and total. The ground is featureless aside from the 
rubble, save for trenches dug four feet deep and about fifteen 
feet around. The trenches, like everything else here, are choked

   This valley is a field of shattered rock, debris and

in the rocky walls of the formations. Scattered fragments of 
warped metal poke through the rubble in places, however, and 
could not have originated there.

rock threatens to let slip more of itself onto the rubble below, 
the thickness of ruin that marks this place as utterly as all 
this valley. Burned into that cracked rock wall, close to the 
ground, are man-sized and roughly human silhouettes. Two of the

discernible in the plane of burned-in shadow.

   Walking here is a logistics puzzle. Moves, save for those by 
the most athletic and foolhardy, must be planned. Clear ground 
in this field of blasted ruin and sharply fragmented rock is 
rare. Paths that seem promising lead the walker into treacherous 
dead-ends, islanded amongst yards-high piles of incinerated 
debris too unstable to find purchase upon. Occasionally, an 
errant stumble may yield the discovery of several trenches dug 
into the ground, four feet deep and fifteen feet around. Like

An Austere Corridor~
   Lacking any sort of ornamentation, this austere corridor's 
cement walls, floor, and ceiling have been painted a pristine 
white, lending it the feeling of being more spacious than it 
actually is. To the west is a sturdy-looking titon door, the 
word 'SECURITY' painted in yellow letters across its surface. 
The hallway continues to the north and the south.

A Security Station~
   While this white cement room is easily large enough to house 
ten people, it feels smaller due to the array of lockers and 
equipment that neatly line its walls. Dominating the western 
side of the room is a wide control console connected to a few 
monitors, its design complicated but obviously temporary. The 
area funnels into an alcove cluttered with parts and machinery to 
the north, and a sturdy-looking titon door lies to the east.

A Cluttered Robotics Bay~
   A chaotic arrangement of mechanical components, tools, and 
assorted electrical parts has accumulated against the walls of 
this confined robotics bay, creating a small clearing in the 
center of the room. The smell of burnt solder and axle grease 
hangs heavily in the air here, strong enough to overpower the 
senses. The clutter ends at an invisible line to the south, 
clearly distinguishing the beginning of the security station 
beyond.

   The acerbic scent of chemicals lingers in the air within this

Personnel Living Quarters~
   This large, white-walled room appears to serve as the living 
quarters for this facility's personnel. It is utilitarian in 
design, lacking adornments and containing only a few pieces of 
functional furniture. The western wall is lined with a row of 
bunk beds, while the eastern wall houses a small kitchen alcove.

barren of personality; a few simple abstract paintings hang here, 
and a polyplast bookshelf rests against the western wall. The 
living space appears to be designed for one occupant, most likely

A Large, Sterile Laboratory~
   This large, pristine white room contains many of the items you 
would expect to find in a typical lab: a chemical shower, a 
laminar flow cabinet, and an assortment of containers and 
measuring equipment. Lurking among these innocuous objects, 
however, is a collection of unfamiliar devices laden with clear 
tubing, a writhing, quicksilver-like substance churning through 
each. The air here has a sterile scent, bereft of the familiar 
odors of life. The room extends to the east and the south, and a 
small, recessed door is set in the western wall. To the north, a 
wall of thick glass separates the lab from the corridor beyond, 
with a metal-framed door allowing passage through it.

though the noise is barely detectable over the loud whirring

cement walls bear a few grimy fingerprints, and a pin-up hangs 
crookedly, held in place by a few strips of transparent tape. To

   The cloying stench of smoke and burnt flesh clings to this

the southern wall belies this room's true purpose: it is a 
cremation furnace, and judging by the scorch marks in the cement 
surrounding it, it looks to have seen quite a bit of use. A sole 
doorway to the north offers a means of exiting this place.

transparent tubes, some channeling a translucent orange fluid 
while others course with an eerie, quicksilver-like substance. 
The tubes eventually run into the wall, carrying their contents 
to destinations unknown. The air here has a sterile scent,
