The Junkyard~
   The landscape around consists of nothing but the ruins of a 
city; shattered buildings, defiled monuments, shards of glass, 
and remains of machinery loom in the distance. Leveled buildings 
cover the place, and countless slanted roofs, walls, and cracked 
parts of streets allow access through these ruins. A toppled 
apartment-tower lies off to the side, a mere husk now. Though 
the sign above the caved-in entrance was once legible, all 
letters appear to have been knocked off by some trauma. An acrid 
smell, such as that of motor oil, pervades the area.

in every direction. A graveyard of twisted furniture lies here, 
now only good for scrap metal, and many piles dot the area, 
making passage across convoluted and difficult. Additionally, a 
toppled apartment-tower lies off to the side, a mere husk now. 
Half of a neon sign is still legible above the caved-in entrance, 
some of its bolded unlit red letters reading as: "--TEL, ALWAYS 
HERE FOR YOU". A musty old smell, reminiscent of mold and rust 
saturates the air.

The Junkyard~
   If this was once a noble city, it is now only plundered ruins 
and charred metal. The ground beneath one's feet is all packed 
dirt, solid as iron and a hard, dull gray. The clearing, used 
for whatever purpose, is stripped of all scrap and junk - it is 
as clear as the name implies, surrounded on all sides by heaps of 
scrap. A massive crater envelopes a great part of this area, 
made by some kind of explosion. A pervasive smell of iron - like 
blood - hangs heavily in the area.

   With the scrap-heap remains of the city resting in ruin below on this steep 
slope, the second tier is in somewhat better condition. Northward is blocked 
off by a gigantic iron-alloy billboard, with face-less figures of a happy 
couple. Their visages have been over-written with layers upon layers of 
spray-painted graffiti, faded by time to an almost uniform dullness. To the 
west is a burned out husk of an apartment-tower, blocked off by fallen chunks 
of the building itself. Though the sign above the blocked off entrance was 
once legible, all the letters appear to have been knocked off by some trauma.

A Littered Street Along the Apartment Tower~
   Littered debris scatters the ground in the form of balled paper-like 
polyprop, a few rusted bits of forgotten household items, even the occasional 
rusted by otherwise serviceable vehicle. To the west is a still towering 
apartment structure, rising upward in a stately fashion. Many of the windows 
have been smashed out, littering the ground in glittering glass, but some still 
remain in place, dirty and dusty. The street is still intact and though a few 
places of crumbling show through the riff-raff, the polycrete would be easily 
traversable otherwise.

The Ruined Path Curves~
   The landscape along the street is far from destroyed but does show a certain 
amount of age-old violence and disrepair. Polycrete buildings lay abandoned, 
bearing faded paint and shattered windows. Monuments crafted of iron-alloy 
have been long ago defiled by spray paint, showing monikers "#1Skin that's red? 
Shoot it dead!#0" and "#6Ten Fingers, Ten Toes. Or it goes!#0". Modern 
architecture is obvious in the shape and design of the buildings and the intact 
road beneath holds together perfectly. Marring the surface of the road and 
sidewalk are piles of trash and abandoned vehicles.

A Pathway Through a Building~
   The street running in from the west abruptly ends and in it's stead is a 
degenerated wall. The surface of this wall has been reduced and is easily 
passable, but further inside proves that this area is infact the remnants of an 
edifice. Metal gateways strown about the landscape, combined with various 
trashed signs, give evidence of a former shopping area. A built-in desk still 
clings to what can only be the floor of this room. The fact that it does not 
move proves that it had been built into the structure itself. Past the snaking 
path that is the rubble, is the remainder of the street.

A Fallen Walkway in the Path~
   A walkway has collapsed in the center of this street, presumably from the 
tier aboe. With it are various advertisements for a market-hotel combination 
that have been bent beneath the weight of the structure. Glass panels on these 
advertisements are nothing more than spider-webbed husks of their former 
selves. Otherwise impassable, the destroyed catwalk makes a narrow pathway 
further down the ride. Surrounding it are jagged support beams that jut from 
the rubble. A fallen billboard sign appears to be wedged into the steep slope, 
allowing access to the tier above if someone were courageous enough to attempt 
it.

On an Overshadowed Plateau~
   The upper tier of this high-rise plateau offers a breathtaking view of the 
far extended moonscape, marred by the destroyed husks of buildings, 
filth-stained, crumbling walls and the seemingly endless heaps of discarded 
scrap. A tarnished chrion frame has crashed in front of an collapsed, arching 
doorway, the unprotected canvas having decayed ages ago and leaving only 
clinging polymesh to flutter like ghosts in a passing wind. The stench of 
decay hangs heavily in the air, settling over the dense expanse of the skeletal 
buildings which cast dark shadows throughout. Broken and shattered by some 
kind of explosion, the dark asphalt roadway looks to have once been smoothly 
paved. Decorative ceramic planters lay in ruin on either side of this main 
street, whatever they contained disintegrated by the elements.

   The smoothly paved roadway looks to drop off sharply on the north side, the 
ornamental barriers that may have once extended onto a platform have been 
warped. The looming architecture extends to the south, many chipped motifs 
with geometric mosaics of obscure patterns still visible upon the higher 
levels. Artful, planters have been cracked and torn open from where they are 
embedded in a half semi-circle, this area once serving as some sort of 
commercial park. A tripled-tiered polyconcrete fountain is empty and dry, the 
contents dusty and riddled with a few noteable bulletholes. The shadows that 
overwhelm this area are blocked off by the natural light which pours in from 
the open northern skyline.

structures block out the view of the sky, their multi-tiered frames rising to 
remarkable heights within this desolate ruin. A blackened, imperial building 
rises along the eastern side of the street, the thick walls have crumbled in 
uneven, disheveled blocks granting an unhindered view to the stately, but 
decayed rooms within. Hanging precariously by woven cables high against a 
pillared building is an enormous smashed panel, the frayed wires and damaged 
circuitry dangling to the second level and quavering back and forth in the 
slightest wind.

A Ravaged Commercial Sector~
   The majority of the decrepit buildings in this sector look to have been 
mostly high-rises, an excess of decorative iron-alloy plating used within the 
construction. The secured flat-paneled paneling is heavily tarnished by 
oxidation, many of them hopelessly smashed outwards as if there was an 
explosion from the inside. A slanted billboard hangs dangerously from one 
corner, creaking every so often with a grating metallic groan. The decomposing 
states has the majority of the sun-bleached lettering illegible, making out 
barely, "#6T_N FING__S, TE_ TOE_, OTHERW_SE IT GOES!#0". The paved streets 
have been upheaved by a formidably sized crater, the large cracks splitting in 
a jagged array through the polyconcrete. To the south, the shadows of a number 
of looming buildings can be seen, while they seem to fall off sharply on the 
northern side.

A Wide Roadway Between Towering Buildings~
   Monumental structures receed in the distance, the irrevocable damage which 
felled their mighty frames apparent through their silhouettes alone. The wide 
street is bisected by an immense, hollow chrion sphere which clearly fell off 
the destroyed overcropping of a nearby building. The elaborate, interwoven 
links are severely crushed and dented, one side hopelessly charred and 
blackened. Any standing architecture that hasn't completely crumbled is rather 
impressive with arched designs, sculpted pillars and some of the walls still 
carrying the faded signs of extensive murals. Chunks of the road have been 
upheaved by numerous craters, sending polyconcrete debris to integrate amongst 
the strewn refuse. Dust swirls along the abandoned streets like a low-hanging 
haze, any wind bringing with it the undeniable stench of decay and sulfur.

   If this was once a noble city, it is now only plundered ruins 
and charred metal. The collapse of buildings has made the way 
forward mostly enveloped by toppled walls and roofs, and 
maze-like through countless doors, corridors, blown-open walls, 
windows, and makeshift openings. Twisted remains of metal fences 
and rubble entangle the area, requiring careful attention to 
traverse through. A pervasive smell of iron - like blood - hangs 
heavily in the area.

   If this was once a noble city, it is now only plundered ruins

dirt, solid as iron and a hard, dull gray. The clearing, used 
for whatever purpose, is stripped of all scrap and junk - it is 
as clear as the name implies, surrounded on all sides by heaps of 
scrap. Completely crumpled-in gray shells of what appears to be 
shops lie on the side, destroyed by some unnamed trauma. A 
noxious smell, such as that of sulfur, hangs thickly in the area.

and numerous other machines. An acrid smell, such as that of

A Broken Roadway in the Commercial Sector~
   Many of the high-rising buildings have been constructed with faux-marble or 
faux-basalt stones, pillars and decorative motifs half-crumbled, but still 
impressive. On the northeastern side of the paved roadway, a multi-tiered 
building stands towering with most of the windows blown out or shattered 
through time. The ones that remain look to be plated with tinted, mosaic glass 
in sharp, geometric patterns. Polymesh tatters waver like ghosts in the 
passing breezes, stuck upon rubble or twisted metal shards. Painted into an 
elaborate mural are the words "#6Ho_ns on its Hea_? Kick the bast_rd dead!#0", 
the painted family beside it looking serene despite the blackened mar that 
blemishes the concrete. The wide roadway continues to the west and south, the 
paving chipped out into thin cracks.

A Shadowy Intersection Between Impressive Buildings~
   The staggered silhouettes of substantial buildings extend outwards in all 
directions, their dark shadows obscuring most of the natural light that is 
spread through the hollow shells. An impressive structure of pure faux-basalt 
stones, largely intact, dominates the southern side of the road, stretching at 
least a block in either direction. The etched metal sign was mounted above the 
overhanging, but hovers now at a slant, the rivets that secured them tenuous in 
their hold. Crafted into a woman of pure, tarnished metal, an elaborate and 
massive scupture spins two spheres in the center of the landscaped median. 
Half of her face has been destroyed, leaving a gaping and menacing hole rather 
than a beautiful figure. The blackened, engine-less frames of enormous 
machines block the majority of the road, the paving hopelessly cracked with 
jagged crevices. 
   Here stands a great structure, a glittering golden man at the apex.

A Small Residential Walkway~
   This small walkway bears the same intricate inlay that designs other parts 
of the road, moving west to east. In fish-tail design, the geometric patterns 
are created by simple variance in hues. A few smaller but well-crafted homes 
line the north and south, each of the entrances blocked off by either plastic 
barricades or myriad poly-crete planters. Classical and geometric architecture 
are married in combinations of angles and arcs, embellished with ornate 
edifices. Beyond, northward and southward, the two lower tiers of the junkyard 
rest in all their crushed and crumbled glory, getting progressively more 
demolished the further downward traveled.

A Crossroads along a Residential Street~
   To the west, the dramatic display of architecture remains in place with 
darkened windows appearing like empty eyes in the otherwise beautiful edifices. 
The design is a mixture of geometric and classical lines, with swooping arches 
and inlaid faux-basalt. Thick polyprop plastic sheets have been shoved into 
place to block the doors, perhaps a protective measure, and effectively make 
the entrances impossible to traverse. The road is inset with similarly-hued 
moon stone, crafted in intricate fish-tail design, stretching northward and 
eastward. In the distance, the dismal scene of a once breathtaking overlook 
shows the two lower tiers in progressive ruin.

   Though plundered by looting and trash littered around, this space seems 
largely intact otherwise. The polycrete road is still quite serviceable, lined 
with slightly elevated sidewalks. Every so often, round moon stone planters 
stand with barren and cracked soil still caked within. The occasional street 
lamp rises upward, dark with lack of electricity and in most cases the tops 
having been shattered. Done in aged spray paint, the words #6"A Claw on Each 
Hand? Then it's Banned!"#0 has been scrawled upon the faux brick facades.

A Rubble-Strewn Street Between Immense Buildings~
   The landscape is blocked by the skeletal frames of lofty structures, the 
ages old architecture hinting to lavish in its design it once was. An acrid 
smell of motor oil settles heavily over the whole of the sector. A notable row 
of square-shaped buildings with the windows blown out are blocked off by 
numerous flats of soldered scrap metal, impeeding entry both in and out. 
Blocky red lettering has been sprayed upon the side of the building in harsh 
graffiti, completely illegible through time. A massive hollow-metal sculpture 
has fallen in the center of the paved road, once forged into the artful design 
of a sleek mechanized prototype. Now missing limbs and half of its face, the 
construction was still elaborate.

An Unstable Deadend~
   Most signs of ruin imaginable are manifested here at this dead end, in 
varying degrees. The area is walled off by a building that now lays on it's 
side and directly across it, a steep slope of old vehicles and trash support 
beams that jut from the heaping pile. The very ground itself is on the cusp of 
crumbling in some parts, although mostly remaining in good conditions in 
others. Weight added in certain areas causes the polycrete floor to shift, 
threatening to drop into the massive crater that lies to the east. Tattered 
poster have been tacked to the debris, making statements along the lines of:

A Vast Overlook~
   This vast overlook is left bare for viewing, with two immense statuesque 
homes on either side of it. The homes are palatial, even more than the homes 
moving southward along the road, and appear in almost perfect condition. 
Though they lack in greenery, as the planters have long-since become nothing 
more than couriers for barren and cracked soil, they have such flourish in 
their design that they don't need further decoration. Massive faux-marble 
columns lift upward, bearing two separate levels. Encircling each structure 
and each level are expansive porches, banisters displaying intricately carved 
spirals in the polywoodgrain. The twin homes look to be almost mirror images 
of each other, with the disparity of varying paint shades that over time have 
faded to become nothing more than a minor detail. Crafted as a cul de sac, 
this road bears the same dramatic mosaic that trails southward however the 
inlay is in a pattern of a sunburst, the slight variance in color behind a 
subtle cue to that design.

A Narrow Pathway Broadening Toward the South~
   This area has been forced into a narrow pathway running north and south. On 
either side are crude barricades constructed from scrap and alloy panels topped 
with vicious pronged wires that coil around rusted pipes. Metal clothes lines 
string across the buildings from west to east, but upon closer inspection these 
lines appear to be electrical cabling that has long sense yielded a neglectful 
demise. Furniture has been sparsely scattered about but has been rendered 
useless by a history of chaos.

A Desolate Commercial Sector~
   The shells of soaring buildings dominate this area, the majority of the 
entrances blocked by crumbled hunks of polyconcrete or large, mangled slabs of 
twisted metal. Destroyed pillars have been knocked out of a nearby building by 
some form of explosion, the sculptured artistry upon them shattered from 
impact. Obscure geometric displays are decorated into many of the buildings, 
the triangular shapes individually tiled with care. Chrion sheets have been 
secured to a nearby wall, the etched propoganda still legible, "#6Skin that's 
Red? Shoot it de_d! More th_n tw_ eyes? Then it dies!#0". Similar postings 
seem to have been made in common, elaborate form throughout all of this tiers, 
decidedly more intricate than the other levels, but the message remaining 
clear. The road continues to the north and south, the rubble creating a 
precarious, winding path.

A Winding Path Beside Flame-Licked Buildings~
   The path winds west and south with the eastern way cut off by shattered gray 
shells of buildings that have collapsed in what seems to be a domino effect. 
Along the north wall, a completely blackened section of buildings towers above, 
flame-licked long ago. Rubble-marred shacks line the area and have fallen to 
the ground. Muted, with little variant hues present, this pathway has fallen 
into crude display, reminiscent of a distant, better time.

A Winding Pathway Beneath a Looming Skyscraper~
   A building to the south has collapsed, conjoining with another 
superstructure to the north and shrouding this area from light even when the 
sun beats down above. It's husk looms over the bath in an almost menacing 
manner. Continuing eastward and westward, this road is largely intact although 
mostly covered with trash and the like. Free from electricity, lamp posts 
pepper the sidewalk every so often, for the most part standing as nothing more 
than a reminder of what once was.

A T-shaped, Fabricated Path~
   The artificially constructed walkway from the west, made from the same rusty 
metal as the space surrounding it, suddenly ceases. Industrial-sized 
mechanisms lay in disrepair, most far gone to elements and the never-ceasing 
winds. Set to both the east and south are treks through the trash-littered 
road, vehicles lining the sidewalks and abandoned ages ago. The road itself 
holds together perfectly, despite being covered and hidden beneath the remains 
of a hasty retreat, the trash left behind by society.

A Man-made Path Leading Further into the City~
   The destruction of this tier is much more marginal, although many signs of 
disrepair do remain obvious. A row of buildings along the south has had large, 
ragged holes bored throughout. Despite this, the interiors remain intact and 
are concealed by polycrete that has been reduced into piles of rubble as 
barricades. A sign to the immediate west offers #2Minnie's Makeup#0, though 
posters cover the rest of what the sign has to offer, in bright blazoned words 
stating, #2"More than two eyes? Then it dies!"#0

The Junkyard~
   The landscape around consists of nothing but the ruins of a 
city; shattered buildings, defiled monuments, shards of glass, 
and remains of machinery loom in the distance. The collapse of 
buildings has made the way forward mostly enveloped by toppled 
walls and roofs, and maze-like through countless doors, 
corridors, blown-open walls, windows, and makeshift openings. 
The bent remains of what might have been a basketball hoop stands 
tilted on the side, the net and hoop itself long gone. Only the 
rusted torn remains of the backboard are intact. The rank smell 
of rot permeates the air.

   The trashed husks of buildings and ruins litter this wrecked

metal teeter on either side of the path - pieces of old machines, 
buildings, computers, tangles of wire, jagged spikes of rusty 
steel, and all manner of torn up, hacked apart, and stripped 
components. Completely crumpled-in gray shells of what appears 
to be shops lie on the side, destroyed by some unnamed trauma.

in every direction. A graveyard of twisted furniture lies here, 
now only good for scrap metal, and many piles dot the area, 
making passage across convoluted and difficult. A massive crater 
envelopes a great part of this area, made by some kind of 
explosion. A noxious smell, such as that of sulfur, hangs 
thickly in the area.

   If this was once a noble city, it is now only plundered ruins 
and charred metal. Shells and husks of broken buildings threaten 
to completely block any further passage; only by squeezing 
through small openings between buildings, through shattered 
windows, and jagged debris is passage possible. Completely 
crumpled-in gray shells of what appears to be shops lie on the 
side, destroyed by some unnamed trauma. Some legible, though 
broken, signs read as: "BUY B-Y B--, NOW FOR HA-", and "NOTHING 
LIKE CARSON'S JEWEL-". An acrid smell, such as that of motor 
oil, pervades the area.

   Every sign of ruin imaginable is manifested here in this 
ruined, looted shell of a city. Asphalt, concrete, scrap metal, 
and rubble lie heaped in haphazard piles along the moderately 
wide path, some even rising up to the height of an average man. 
A toppled apartment-tower lies off to the side, a mere husk now. 
Though the sign above the caved-in entrance was once legible, all 
letters appear to have been knocked off by some trauma. A 
pervasive smell of iron - like blood - hangs heavily in the area.

   The mostly-intact street continues northward here in a straight line, with 
two-story buildings rising up to the east and west. All access points for the 
buildings are obscured by large polycrete barricades which bear warning signs 
upon their fronts. Along the eastern wall a soldier's portrait looms twelve 
feet high, clearly made by a skilled artist using spray-paint. He is clad in a 
brown overcoat and gripping a rifle across his chest, glaring down at any 
passersby. He appears caught in the motion of stepping forward defiantly, and 
below the image vivid red text reads, #1"Destroy Abnormality!"#0

A Curving Intact Road~
   If this was once a noble city, it appears as a toothless shadow of itself 
now. Though most of the buildings appear intact, several of them show obvious 
wear, having lost much of their peripheral facades and decorative designs. 
This road curves slightly northward and westward, with the south lined by what 
were once apartments. Any doors have been blocked off by thick plastic 
barricades, making them impassible. Several posters paper the polycrete 
surfaces of this building, #6"More than two eyes, then it dies!"#0 and #1Horns 
on the head, kick it dead!"#0.

A T-Shaped Crossroads~
   Though far from ruined, this cityscape has seen better days. A crossroads 
moving east and west is blocked only northward by the burned remains of a 
building, bearing blown out windows and blackened polycrete. Glass, from 
windows and probably a variety of other things, decorate the ground and glitter 
in any available light. The road, though covered with crumpled bits of 
paper-like polyprop, looks to be holding together well enough and the slight 
up-step to the sidewalk is denoted by reflective paint that remains mostly true 
to its name.

Before a Battered Overlook~
   Perched on the edge of the second tier, the ruins of the first are laid out 
before the eye. The city beneath is a shattered and broken place, tall 
buildings leaning dangerously against one another, craters easily visible in 
places. Here, however, buildings appear to be in better condition, though many 
have been touched by fire and violence, few windows still remaining. Faded 
posters hang from nearby walls, while a building from the first tier sags 
enough to give access down to the lower level.

   Though this place may have once been habitable, that time is

direction. The ground beneath one's feet is all packed dirt, 
solid as iron and a hard, dull gray. The clearing, used for 
whatever purpose, is stripped of all scrap and junk - it is as 
clear as the name implies, surrounded on all sides by heaps of 
scrap. Completely crumpled-in gray shells of what appears to be 
shops lie on the side, destroyed by some unnamed trauma. The

black rubber jutting out at all angles. A musty old smell, 
reminiscent of mold and rust saturates the air.

An Ancient, Desecrated Sanctuary~
   Cracked stone pews line the main aisle, arranged 
symmetrically, and at a slant that would ease the flow of human 
traffic. However, there is none of that here. Abandoned ages 
ago, nothing occupies this sanctuary but dust, silence, and 
layers of grafitti. Curses, swears, gang signs, and a whole list 
of different people who were apparently here decorate this 
once-holy site, painted right over the few remaining holy relics 
- namely three stone crosses that once stood behind the 
graphically-decorated altar. Of those three crosses only the far 
right one remains intact; the left cross has had one arm broken 
off, and someone has cracked the middle cross from its 
foundation, flipped it over, and leaned it back against the wall. 
   Above the altar and crosses, done large enough and recently 
enough to blot out decades of grafitti, someone has undergone the 
painstaking process of incribing the words: #1"I am he that 
liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; 
and have the keys of hell and of death." - Rev. 1:18#0. The 
writing is in blood.

   Darkness is pervasive, much like the smell that still lingers from mold and 
lightly rusted metal. Buildings remain largely untouched on either side of 
this polycrete street. Some features are perhaps not as they always were. The 
glass has been broken out of many of the windows, hanging open like empty eye 
sockets and the doors are barricaded, many of them chained. Street lamps line 
the sidewalks, serving no purpose as their domes are shattered and free from 
electricity.

armored vehicle stands to some long-past event.

   Though this cracked concrete wall is thick enough to safely

Sections of the wall are unstable and on the brink of collapsing, 
and it rumbles lowly in protest under one's weight. The high 
vantage point allows a full sight of the desolation and decay 
below, and a thick gray fog that sits over the ruins. 
   The wall is abruptly cleaved, a massive fissure running down 
the concrete, and no further passage can be made to the west. A 
passage on the wall is open to the east.

A Curving Trash-lined Road~
   The landscape around consists of glassless windows and worn building 
facades. Once painted polycrete buildings have become weathered and chipped 
with age and the endless winds that wind their way back and forth over the 
moonscape. Trash, forgotten planters filled with cracked soil, and unlit 
sconces line the road, resting on what was one clearly defined sidewalk. With 
the mired piles of junk, the line between sidewalk and road blurs somewhat. 
Along one wall, a faded poster has been plastered to the wall, #6"Wipe That 
Sneer Off His Face!"#0 The faded image beneath is that of an angry looking 
mutant.

The Robotics District~
   This district is eerily pristine. Various squat buildings line the road, 
each with their own small electronic, metal, or polyprop signs. The store are 
all darkened, some with doors open or sealed shut, with or without long-rusted 
equipment in their windows. The road extends for quite some distance before 
coming to form a cul-de-sac, the end of which hosts a broad glass panel that 
rises to an equal height of the nearby buildings. It appears to have once been 
a display of some sort, but now offers a tinted, sweeping view of the moonscape 
beyond. A wide sign stands in the middle of the road, near the plaza's 
entrance, composed of individual, dim electric letters spelling out, 
#C"ROBOT___ _ISTRICT"#0. The central letters appear to have been blown out of 
place, with small bits of wiring and framing scattered on the ground behind the 
sign, providing the only sign of violence the abandoned area.

Before Several Still-grand Homes~
   The entrances to these still-grand homes seem blocked off by one thing or 
another, some using planters of long-dead topiaries as natural barricades, 
others with sheets of thick polyprop plastic guarding the space. Everything 
else remains faded but picturesque, the design of the structures speaking to 
classical and in places geometric aesthetic. Arches, sconces, facades, and 
metallic filigree come across as somewhat heavy-handed but still incredibly 
impressive. The street is patterned in similarly hued moon stone, cobbled 
together in neat fish-tailed mosaic. Just beyond the buildings, a breathtaking 
view can be glimpsed. Perhaps ages ago beautiful, the scene is terrible now, a 
display of the lower two tiers in varying stages of crumbling.

A Faded Palatial Neighborhood~
   Palatial homes line this intact road, inset with dramatic stonework forming 
geometric patterns. The homes rise two to three levels up, most of them with 
faded paint but otherwise free of damage. Architecture appears to be grand in 
design, heavy-handed in arches, decorative facades, and traditional flourishes. 
Ornate planters have been pushed before the doors, perhaps once bearing 
dramatic topiaries but now holding nothing more than cracked and dried soil, 
serving as a makeshift barricade. Beyond each estate is a dramatic drop off, 
showing what was once probably a breathtakingly beautiful view and now is 
similarly breathtaking, in its ruined state.

   The road broadens out here, opening into a wide plaza. One- or two-story 
buildings line the circular area, though much larger structures tower beyond 
them. A separate road extends out of the plaza's western edge, and upon the 
metal floor before it is painted a blue diamond rimmed by a thick white border. 
In its center is a highly-stylized robot head overlaid upon a yellow star, and, 
though somewhat faded, the entire design looks crisp. Right before the 
southern pathway there are two similar designs, bearing the image of a machine 
and circuit board respectively.

faintly, approaching a towering and blackened cluster of buildings and 
warehouses. At the road's base the blue diamond is repeated, indicating a 
machine once again. Another blue diamond is present just to the east, proudly 
displaying a circuit board. Above a few benches placed opposite the 
intersection, a crisp chrion-alloy plaque has been affixed to the wall,

The Junkyard~
   Every sign of ruin imaginable is manifested here in this 
ruined, looted shell of a city. Asphalt, concrete, scrap metal, 
and rubble lie heaped in haphazard piles along the moderately 
wide path, some even rising up to the height of an average man. 
A massive crater envelopes a great part of this area, made by 
some kind of explosion. A musty old smell, reminiscent of mold 
and rust saturates the air.

The Junkyard~
   The shattered cityscape of looted buildings and ruins stretch 
in every direction. The collapse of buildings has made the way 
forward mostly enveloped by toppled walls and roofs, and 
maze-like through countless doors, corridors, blown-open walls, 
windows, and makeshift openings. A giant monstrosity of a tire 
pile looms on the path, consisting of bent and twisted, jagged, 
rotting pieces of black rubber jutting out at all angles. An 
acrid smell, such as that of motor oil, pervades the area.

The Junkyard~
   The landscape around consists of nothing but the ruins of a 
city; shattered buildings, defiled monuments, shards of glass, 
and remains of machinery loom in the distance. Rusting piles of 
scrapmetal teeter on either side of the path - pieces of old 
machines, buildings, computers, tangles of wire, jagged spikes of 
rusty steel, and all manner of torn up, hacked apart, and 
stripped components. Completely crumpled-in gray shells of what 
appears to be shops lie on the side, destroyed by some unnamed 
trauma. Some legible, though broken, signs read as: "G-EAT 
SA-I-GS AT LEHMIN'S", and "FEEL FREE TO FEEL GOOD AT-". The 
thick sensation of smoke chokes one's sense of smell here.

A Bell-less Belfry~
   Situated in the middle of the four towers of the cathedral, 
and nowhere near as tall, this belfry is pretty useless as a 
belfry, as there is a distinct lack of bell. Other than that, it 
is pretty featureless - the stone stairs lead to a stone floor, 
the domed roof is supported by four pillars and no windows, and 
it provides a good view of the area around, sans the areas 
blocked by the cathedral's towers.

Before a Panoramic Outlook~
   The city here has been ravaged by fire, husks of tall buildings standing 
sentinel over the lonely road. After long years of neglect, the remains of the 
structures are listing this way and that, while the wind whistles through the 
gaping hole of their windows. From this vantage, it becomes clear that the 
once-city was indeed built in tiers as southward there's a dramatic drop off, 
showing the ruin below in panoramic view.

The Junkyard~
   Though this place may have once been habitable, that time is 
long over and city ruins, and more city ruins comprise every 
direction. The going becomes convoluted and narrow here as 
numerous scrap piles, heaped impossibly high with twisted metal 
and unrecognizable junk, constrict the way to a snaking, winding 
path. The smashed remains of what appears to be a concrete 
statue is scattered here and there; a once regal head defiled by 
indistinct graffiti, an arm, two halves of a torso, and countless 
shards of what must have been body parts lie strewn. A noxious 
smell, such as that of sulfur, hangs thickly in the area.

The Junkyard~
   If this was once a noble city, it is now only plundered ruins 
and charred metal. Shells and husks of broken buildings threaten 
to completely block any further passage; only by squeezing 
through small openings between buildings, through shattered 
windows, and jagged debris is passage possible. A massive crater 
envelopes a great part of this area, made by some kind of 
explosion. A musty old smell, reminiscent of mold and rust 
saturates the air.

evident here, entire parts of it have been upheaved and cause the 
footing to be uneven, and other portions are on the cusp of 
crumbling. Twisted remains of metal fences and rubble entangle 
the area, requiring careful attention to traverse through. The 
thick sensation of smoke chokes one's sense of smell here.

An Entrenched Outlook~
   The edge of this tier looms beyond, what was once a scenic outlook clearly 
having been turned into a makeshift battlefield at some point in the past. 
Crudely cut trenches criss-cross the landscape, pushing aside the polycrete 
road-surface. The ruined husks of small buildings pepper the edge, though most 
are uninhabitable. The lower tier of the Junkyard spreads out before the 
outlook, a sheer drop leading down to the ruined and shattered streets beneath. 
Throughout the area are peppered ancient bones, crumbling at the slightest 
touch. Discolored shell casings surround the grim sentinels.

Narrow Path Between Buildings~
   Multiple standing sentinels of buildings remain dormant and dark, to both 
the west, east, and south. Cracked hydraulics and burnt circuitry are 
mainstays, although with the power and the water shut off completely they 
appear as simple design features, silent decoration to the outside of the 
buildings they once served. Posters emblazoned with words of #6"Ten fingers, 
Ten toes, or it goes!"#0 have been layered one over the other, papering in 
complete a low wall half-concealing southward. A path is cut roughly through 
the broken wall, allowing for easy movement.

Plaza Near a Ruined Apartment Building~
   Whoever built the city built it in tiers, both visible from the vantage 
point provided here. Spreading out to the south is the first tier, the 
entirety nearly completely leveled. The occasional structure rises from the 
heap, but most are thrust sideways or at queer angles. To the north stands the 
upper tier, buildings in poor shape yet standing sentinel through the years. 
Billboards and advertisements are scattered along the divide, the occasional 
building scaling to the upper tier. Whatever mechanism that the original 
residents used for transportation is long gone. To the north stands a squat 
apartment building, upper floors appearing gutted by fire. The street level 
appears intact, however.

At a Crossroads~
   The empty husks of dark polycrete buildings line this abandoned road, 
bearing the marks of light fighting. The polycrete roads remain intact though 
littered with refuse, trash of those long gone inhabitants. Planters and lamps 
are interspersed throughout the makeshift sidewalk, free of light and life 
depending. Dust hangs heavy in the air and on the surfaces, thick enough to 
withstand the ever shifting winds.

The Junkyard~
   If this was once a noble city, it is now only plundered ruins 
and charred metal. The ground beneath one's feet is all packed 
dirt, solid as iron and a hard, dull gray. The clearing, used 
for whatever purpose, is stripped of all scrap and junk - it is 
as clear as the name implies, surrounded on all sides by heaps of 
scrap. A toppled apartment-tower lies off to the side, a mere 
husk now. Though the sign above the caved-in entrance was once 
legible, all letters appear to have been knocked off by some 
trauma. The rank smell of rot permeates the air.

The Junkyard~
   The trashed husks of buildings and ruins litter this wrecked 
city, with no sign of reprieve in sight. Rusting piles of scrap 
metal teeter on either side of the path - pieces of old machines, 
buildings, computers, tangles of wire, jagged spikes of rusty 
steel, and all manner of torn up, hacked apart, and stripped 
components. A giant monstrosity of a tire pile looms on the 
path, consisting of bent and twisted, jagged, rotting pieces of 
black rubber jutting out at all angles. An acrid smell, such as 
that of motor oil, pervades the area.

The Junkyard~
   The landscape around consists of nothing but the ruins of a 
city; shattered buildings, defiled monuments, shards of glass, 
and remains of machinery loom in the distance. The ground 
beneath one's feet is all packed dirt, solid as iron and a hard, 
dull gray. The clearing, used for whatever purpose, is stripped 
of all scrap and junk - it is as clear as the name implies, 
surrounded on all sides by heaps of scrap. A toppled 
apartment-tower lies off to the side, a mere husk now. Though 
the sign above the caved-in entrance was once legible, all 
letters appear to have been knocked off by some trauma. The rank 
smell of rot permeates the air.

The Junkyard~
   The shattered cityscape of looted buildings and ruins stretch 
in every direction. Leveled buildings cover the place, and 
countless slanted roofs, walls, and cracked parts of streets 
allow access through these ruins. Completely crumpled-in gray 
shells of what appears to be shops lie on the side, destroyed by 
some unnamed trauma. An acrid smell, such as that of motor oil, 
pervades the area.

The Junkyard~
   Every sign of ruin imaginable is manifested here in this 
ruined, looted shell of a city. Asphalt, concrete, scrap metal, 
and rubble lie heaped in haphazard piles along the moderately 
wide path, some even rising up to the height of an average man. 
The bent remains of what might have been a basketball hoop stands 
tilted on the side, the net and hoop itself long gone. Only the 
rusted torn remains of the backboard are intact. A pervasive 
smell of iron - like blood - hangs heavily in the area.

   Though this place may have once been habitable, that time is 
long over and city ruins, and more city ruins comprise every 
direction. The remains of a street evident here, entire parts of 
it have been upheaved and cause the footing to be uneven, and 
other portions are on the cusp of crumbling. Completely 
crumpled-in gray shells of what appears to be shops lie on the 
side, destroyed by some unnamed trauma. Some legible, though 
broken, signs read as: "CONNECTING YOU WITH EVERYONE ELSE, NOREBO 
WIRE-", and "ANDERS WORKS MIRA-CL-S". The rank smell of rot 
permeates the air.

   The shattered cityscape of looted buildings and ruins stretch 
in every direction. The going becomes convoluted and narrow here 
as numerous scrap piles, heaped impossibly high with twisted 
metal and unrecognizable junk, constrict the way to a snaking, 
winding path. A stone plinth, spidery cracks running along it, 
stands without any ornamentation - whatever it once held up has 
been long since looted. A musty old smell, reminiscent of mold 
and rust saturates the air.

Between Looming Warehouses~
   The dramatic heights of buildings seem to expand to the northwestern side of 
this elaborately constructed tier, though the significant states of destruction 
are apparent even from this distance. Elongated warehouses taper eastwards, 
their dented metal sheeting walls tarnished and blackened. High above the 
doorways, several enormous flat-panelled screens have been shattered and 
ruined, still bolted securely into the polyconcrete. Defunct and worthless 
machinery shells have been barricaded against the doors, blocking attempts at 
entry. Dust litters the street in a haze that clings to the ground, the 
pavement riddled with torturous cracks.

A Decaying Park Between Warehouses~
   The cityscape expands to the northwest, the towering high-rises jutting 
their immense structures skywards far in the distance. The western roadway 
ends into a once landscaped courtyard with unhindered views setting upon the 
ruins of the tiers below and to the vast moonscape beyond. Low basalt walls 
mostly still stand in a circular shape, centered upon the now empty platform, 
rivets and circuitry jutting up and frayed from where the lost object was 
ripped off. Secured benches sit beside decayed shrubs, the paint that was 
lacquered upon the faux-wood peeling and stripped. The shells of what appears 
to have once been greenhouses sit beyond the warehouses, the staggering piles 
of scraps and polyconcrete blocks impeeding any exploratory efforts in those 
directions.

The Beginning of the Electronics District~
   This district stretches along the road for a great distance, with the 
immediate area lined by a collection of shops. This area is entirely pristine, 
the darkened and shuttered buildings along the road appearing intact. They 
have been carefully sealed by wide metal barriers, entirely inaccessible. 
Further to the east, the short commercial portion of the district gives way to 
larger industrial buildings, which even from a distance have clearly been 
assaulted.

Ruined Apartment Lobby~
   The ruins of a utopian lobby spread out from a pair of shattered double 
doors, the polywood finish that coats them having long been blasted off by 
innumerable years of relentless wind. At the far end of the lobby is a 
dilapidated desk, faded and cracked polyprop barely holding together. 
Spreading from one side of the hall to the other, it is emblazoned with the 
words, #6Beyond The Sea Apartments#0. The words are cracked in several places, 
the occasional bullet hole standing testament to some violent past. Staircases 
on either side of the room have been heavily barricaded from above, various 
pieces of broken furniture and random bits of metal having been forced 
together, preventing entry. A #6painting#0 hangs near the doors, still having 
managed to hang on despite years of neglect.

An Abrupt End to the Electronics District~
   The large buildings on either side of this portion of the Electronics 
District have been seriously damage. Propaganda posters line the wall, those 
which are unscorched or twisted reading phrases such as, #6"Ten fingers, ten 
toes, otherwise it goes!"#0 and #6"Horns on its head? Kick the bastard dead!"#0 
Further to the east, one of the colossal warehouses has collapsed across the 
road, the twisted hulk of metal penetrating the floor in some portions. The 
visible metal is heavily damaged and scorched, providing a clear testament that 
it was the target of a significant attack. It cuts off all sight and view of 
what lies beyond the sprawling wreck, jarringly shattering the geometric 
neatness characteristic of the area.

Upon A Precarious Plateau on the Third Tier~
   The sculptured architecture of this high level tier stands at impressive 
heights in shadowed shells in most directions. Many of the buildings having 
crumbled into arching piles of polyconcrete blocks with an overwhelming amount 
of dust sweeping the paved ground. An ornamental metal fence seemed to have 
once lined the craggy southern slope, but the alloy is warped and twisted, half 
hanging off of the edge and hopelessly blackened. The smell of fetid rot 
interwoven with a heavy acrid odor clogs this area, dimming the sweeping view 
of the lower junkyard tiers and the haze of the moonscape far beyond. The 
streets appear to have once been smoothly paved, but deep craters and cracks 
now dominate the roadways.

A Riddled Street in the Commercial District~
   The expansive cityscape is riddled with the soaring silhouettes of sizeable 
buildings laden with sweeping architecture. A disjointed sidewalk of 
decorative tiles flanks the roadway, strewn asunder by numerous cracks and 
debris. Within the western wall is an intricate relief of a futuristic scene, 
the figures of expansive robots mingled with the composed expressions of normal 
humans. The words, "#6The F_ture W_thin Our Gra_p: No Mutan_s.#0" having been 
chiseled with definition above the artistic decoration. Abandoned windows on 
the tall buildings would have given an impressive view to the streets below and 
the surrounding lower tiers, now shattered with tinted shards of glass 
providing traces of the creativity once employed in the construction of this 
level.

reads: 'New! ULTRA M- BLE-! On sale now!' The sickly funk of 
decay hangs in the air.

A Dangerous Tangle of Wiring~
   This is literally a wall of twisted wire mesh and remains of 
fencing. By either coincidence, or by purpose, all manners of 
wire have ended up atop the ruins to form a climbable wall. The 
going is dangerous - jagged metal and bent wiring creates a 
thorny passage up. And by no means, is it a gentle slope up, but 
a rather steep climb.

The Industrial District~
   This stretch of road seems far more confined than the plaza behind, with 
towering buildings rising to the front and on either side. The road is 
slightly narrower here, though easily wide enough for cargo vehicles to access 
the warehouses. Despite the area's industrial focus it has been designed with 
great attention toward aesthetic beauty, and on the road's borders small murals 
and engravings have been studiously constructed. The warehouses and buildings 
were at one point constructed in angular, pristine arrangements to maximize 
beauty and efficiency, but they have sustained considerable damage, metal walls 
darkened heavily and entrances covered by twisted hulks of metal.

A Trash-littered Road~
   While obviously worn down by time and the ever-present winds that sweep 
endlessly back and forth, the structures that make up this space remain 
constant. Polycrete buildings stand mostly tall, though a few of them have 
lost some of the peripheral designs, overhangs broken off or crumbled and 
creating a small amount of litter on the ground. Some trash rustles on the 
ground, bits of paper-thin polyprop that were once probably posters, curtains, 
or any number of other things. Along the southern portion of the road are the 
remains of a checkpoint of some sort, though much of it has been torn down and 
litters the area. An observation tower has been tipped at some point, and 
stretches across the road.

The Junkyard~
   The trashed husks of buildings and ruins litter this wrecked 
city, with no sign of reprieve in sight. Rusting piles of scrap 
metal teeter on either side of the path - pieces of old machines, 
buildings, computers, tangles of wire, jagged spikes of rusty 
steel, and all manner of torn up, hacked apart, and stripped 
components. The bent remains of what might have been a 
basketball hoop stands tilted on the side, the net and hoop 
itself long gone. Only the rusted torn remains of the backboard 
are intact. A musty old smell, reminiscent of mold and rust 
saturates the air.

Scaling a Tilted Building~
   A slim gray tower of a building has toppled over in its ruin, 
suspended up only by a thick high concrete wall. The way up is 
precarious, as only shattered windows and blasted walls provide 
handholds to climb. The concrete that the tower is composed of 
rumbles in protest under weight - a surely winding, treacherous 
and tiring climb up. The piles of scrap metal and looted shells 
of buildings can be seen below.

Atop an Enormous Scrap Heap~
   This scrap heap is impossibly high, and all manners of things 
have been piled, and piled, and piled atop each other until it 
loomed over the sky. Warped furniture, broken wires that snake 
out like entangling vines, rubble, scrap metal, and countless 
unidentifiable pieces of junk compose this heap. It is heaped on 
as to slope up, though it is no doubt a strenuous and dangerous 
climb up for those brave enough.

Up a Collapsed Billboard~
   Bent out of shape, this felled billboard provides an avenue of 
climbing if one is daring enough. Its warped metal pole that 
once held it up, scored and scorched in numerous places, has 
precarious handholds at best and slants up toward another 
gigantic heap of scrap metal, piled ever higher into the sky.

Up a Collapsed Billboard~
   If it were not for the broken billboard, there would be no real way up this 
steep slope. The indentations present upon the pocked polyplastic surface 
provides some semblance of footholds to allow one to climb, but the path itself 
is precarious. The upper plateau stands above, the shadows of immense 
buildings far int he distance. The view below contains a wide spread of heaps 
of scrap metal, several convoluted pieces of metal announcing a disasterous 
fate for anyone who would lose their grip in their ascension.

Climbing a Teetering Scrap Heap~
   All manner of scrap metal has been heaped together. 
Nondescript metal, the remains of rims, pipes, husks of machinery 
are stacked on top of one another - seemingly without thought, 
for any amount of weight exerted on this heap makes it teeter, 
swaying dangerously. Climbing this would require the utmost care 
not to turn this scrap heap into an avalanche of debris and 
metal.

An Ancient, Desecrated Sanctuary~
   Cracked stone pews line the main aisle, arranged 
symmetrically, and at a slant that would ease the flow of human 
traffic. However, there is none of that here. Abandoned ages 
ago, nothing occupies this sanctuary but dust, silence, and 
layers of grafitti. Curses, swears, gang signs, and a whole list 
of different people who were apparently here decorate this 
once-holy site, painted right over the few remaining holy relics 
- namely three stone crosses that once stood behind the 
graphically-decorated altar. Of those three crosses only the far 
right one remains intact; the left cross has had one arm broken 
off, and someone has cracked the middle cross from its 
foundation, flipped it over, and leaned it back against the wall. 
   Above the altar and crosses, done large enough and recently 
enough to blot out decades of grafitti, someone has undergone the 
painstaking process of incribing the words: #1"I am he that 
liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; 
and have the keys of hell and of death."#0 - Rev. 1:18. The 
writing is in blood.

Half Caved-In Factory Floor~
   The landscape around consists of nothing but the ruins of a 
city; shattered buildings, defiled monuments, shards of glass, 
and remains of machinery loom in the distance. Here the debris 
slopes downward into what appears to be the remains of a factory 
- random conveyer belts and machinery litter the splintered 
concrete floor. The structure has collapsed and half of it has 
caved in. All the flooring that is still visible is just 
stained, crumbling concrete.

an apartment. The bathroom is still miraculously intact, with 
toilet and all. The living area however, is all but sundered and 
charred. The apartment is more of a patio to the graveyard of a

the massive long telescope is still intact, but rusted beyond use and corroded. 
The building has long collapsed and all around is debris, random lab equipment, 
and holes. A section of rubble has slid downward to one side, collapsing into 
an apparent sinkhole.

now it's mostly collapsed and buckled in on itself. The white 
concrete is now splattered in mucky, vomit-like colors, and red 
streaks dot the remaining walls like some horrible mural. There 
are scattered remains of desks, melted plastic all around.

   Curiously enough, this apartment flat is relatively intact 
save for the fact it has been completely buried in heaps of slag

buckled in on itself, and the debris has crumbled in such a way 
as to provide a narrow clearing inside the flat. Inside is all

litter the place.

An Expansive, Dome-Shaped Room~
   If it weren't for the pane of thick, clear plastic that makes up the floor, 
this room might in fact be a sphere. It expands high overhead, arching above 
in a smooth, off-white surface that seems unmarred by anything except dust. 
Whatever it was made from appears to have lasted the tell of the years: it is 
impossible to determine how old it is. A number of little alcoves and apparati 
can be seen all over the entirety of it, and down below through the floor - 
which may be unnerving to say the least.

Starboard Corridor at a Blast Door~
   The interior of this hallway is hardly eye catching, mostly a plain grey and 
white expanse of a light, abstract square pattern that is raised against any 
touches put on it. In comparison the floor is rather rough, laid in with 
rubber or something similar that allows a sturdy grip against the bottom and 
clearly made for walking. Most of the interior is completely grey, with the 
floor being a darker hue and the bulkheads painted a rather glaring white. 
Dust has collected on anything it can, dimming the colors and tickling the nose 
when stirred. 
   Here the hallway simply ends, terminating on the starboard side at a blast 
door with a key panel lock to one side. This is dim, dull, and inert. Above 
it is a metal-cast sign which reads: #6 "ATLAS Viewing Room"#0

Starboard Portion of a Corridor Running Starboard to Port~
   Running port to starboard, this corridor has little of note to it. The 
flooring is a textured, rubbery substance and a dark grey. A lighter hue makes 
up the walls, with an abstract square pattern just slightly raised from the 
surface. White bulkheads can be seen along the way, but overall there's not 
really much to look at. Port of this area can be seen some doors recessed into 
the walls, and starboard leads to a blast door.

Along a Starboard Section of a Corridor~
   Recessed into the walls, on the aft and fore sides of the hallway, are two 
doors. Each has a computerized panel next to it, which still contains a faint 
glow and in this area can be heard the almost imperceptible hum of power. To 
the touch, they are cold. The rest of the area is as plain as other parts of 
the corridors, covered in a thin layer of dust. A greyish, faintly raised 
herringbone pattern makes up the square wall panels while a darker, rubberized 
surface is the floor. White bulkheads can be seen up and down the length of 
the hallway. 
   Next to the foreside door is a metal plaque which reads #6"ATLAS Matrix 1"#0 
and next to the aftside door is an identical one marked with #6"ATLAS Matrix 
2"#0.

   Reasonably nondescript, these square-patterned, grey walls continue except 
for an intersection to the port and some recessed doors to starboard. With the 
corridors wide enough for three men to walk shoulder to shoulder, it is 
possible to see this even if not particularly easy. The floor, which is 
rubberized and textured, is a darker grey than the walls while the ceiling and 
bulkheads are white. An end is in sight, a good number of paces to starboard 
where a blast door sits.

Intersection of Metalbound Corridors~
   This area is simply a perpendicular convergence of two corridors, crossing 
each other and then leading off in their respective directions. No widening of 
the area is present, though the corners have been rounded rather than jutting 
out at sharp points. The walls are grey in color, with light herringbone 
texturing on the large, square panels that is difficult to make out. Likewise, 
the floor is grey, though it is rubberized, textured, and darker than the 
walls. The ceiling and bulkheads are white. 
   Painted on one wall in stark black is the block lettering #6"ENGINEERING"#0.

surface is overlaid with a thin coating of dust, which is easily smudged away 
except for the small grooves. Rubberized, darker grey material makes up the 
floor and allows for a firm footing. Reasonably indescript, this corridor runs 
from port to starboard.

rest of them, done in monotone white to dark grey. No black appears to be

   A metal plaque next to the foreside door is marked #6"ATLAS Matrix 4"#0 and 
is matched by one on the aftside door which reads #6"ATLAS Matrix 3"#0.

   In between a door and a pair of doors on either side of the corridor, this 
section is comparatively quite bland. It is made up of heavy metal panels in 
square shapes, lightly textured with a herringbone pattern. The color is grey 
with white bulkheads and overhead. Much darker grey, the floor is some sort of 
rubberized and textured material.

Port End of a Corridor at a Blast Door~
   A large blast door blocks any attempts to go further to the portside of the

partially encircles the room, curving out and around from the port region of 
it. A keyboard can be seen among various other controls, and there is an array 
of screens that covers the portion of the wall above it. Right in front sits a 
spinning, adjustable chair that is very much attached to the floor. It looks 
reasonably ancient.

Just Fore of a T-Junction in a Corridor~
   Like the rest of the corridors, this area is composed of 
herringbone-textured walls, a rubberized darker grey floor with texturing to 
prevent slipping. The ceiling overhead matches the bulkheads in a dingy white. 
This portion, however, allows passage between two blast doors, one on each 
side. The southern hallway looks to have been blocked off, alion beams having 
been laid across it marked with painted #1warning#0 signs. It would still be 
able to be opened and passage to the area beyond by simply avoiding the 
makeshift attempt at blocking it off. 
   A metal plaque hangs on the starboard door, marking it as 
#6"COMMUNICATIONS"#0, while the one on the portside door still reads 
#6"EMERGENCY LADDER"#0.

Aft of an Intersection~
   Just to the aft part of the ship from an intersection, the usual look of the 
corridors takes hold once more. Large, heavy metal panels with a herringbone 
pattern are painted in grey, held by bright white bulkheads that match the 
color of the ceiling. Underfoot is a rubberized, dark grey textured surface 
providing a steady footing. This corridor runs from the fore to the aft.

T-Junction in a Corridor~
   If it were not for the heavy blast door blocking any further passage to the 
aft, this would be a complete intersection. As it is, rounded corners lessen 
the protrusion into the juncture, one corridor running port to starboard, and 
another leading away to the fore end of the ship. Herringbone-patterned, heavy 
grey squares with white bulkheads make up the corridor, and the flooring is a 
rubberized, textured surface. 
   The blast door to the south has a plaque at the top center, reading 
#1"RESTRICTED ACCESS ONLY"#0.

Port of a T-Junction~
   The corridor continues uninterrupted from the junction to the starboard, 
leading off port to a turn. Considering the fairly narrow nature of the 
passage ways, it is somewhat difficult to tell. Around wide enough for three 
men to walk abreast, the area is composed of noticably thicker metal squares. 
They are completely unpainted, but retain the herringbone pattern inherent to 
the structure's materials. The floor is a rubberized, dark grey material.

Turn in a Corridor~
   A fairly tight corner, though the walls have been rounded to prevent sharp 
edges, the hall veers abruptly to the aft end of the ship. Here, the large 
metal panes are completely unpainted, carrying a layer of dust that dulls the 
metallic sheen somewhat. There is also a sort of stifling feeling to the area, 
and sound seems to carry poorly.

Fore of an Intersection~
   The only thing that separates this corridor from any other region running 
from the fore to the aft is that, directly aftwards, there is an intersection. 
It is possible to see from the present standpoint. Other than that, and the 
thin layer of dust that seems to cling to everything, there is little of note 
about this region. It has grey walls textured in a herringbone pattern, a 
rubberized darker grey floor, and white bulkheads that match the ceiling.

Aftward of a Turn in a Corridor~
   Unpainted and covered in a layer of dust, the bolted metal hallway with the 
rubberized floor continues along towards the aft of the ship. It is 
conspicuously quieter than most other areas, little sound seeming to carry. 
Not even footsteps sound off very loudly, and it is difficult to hear further 
down.

Length of a Corridor~
   Set into the grey walls are access hatches, secured with retinal scanners 
and made to be pulled out to allow passage on either side into overhead 
compartments. Portions where the walling has been pulled away prove that the 
scanners are defunct. The rest of the corridor is fairly nondescript, though 
everything might seem thicker than in other regions of the ship. It is very 
quiet, except for an occasional humming sound.

Aft End of a Quiet Corridor~
   Terminating in just an end of the hallway, there is nothing to see. The 
heavy metal panels that form the walls are unpainted, and the floor is a 
rubberized dark grey material. It is very quiet, all sound seeming to be 
muffled except for a faint background hum.

A Turn in a Corridor~
   Here the corridor jaunts off more to the aft after a trip to starboard, 
turning smoothly with rounded edges rather than anything sharp and jarring. It 
is still the same panels of heavy metal, now reinforced and lacking any paint 
even though the rubberized, dark grey walkway continues underfoot. Just 
faintly, like a tinny in the ears, can be heard a humming and the steady droll 
of moving air.

Aft of a Turn in the Corridor~
   From fore to aft, the corridor continues after a turn just a ways down the 
hall. The walls themselves are large, heavy squares of metal held into place 
with bulkheads and textured with a herringbone pattern. Unlike some other 
regions, this area is completely unpainted, left as bare metal.

Aft End of a quiet Corridor~
   All sound seems to be muffled here, perhaps by the extra thick walls or 
something else. Even footsteps don't sound as loudly as they should. The 
rubberized walkway underfoot stops just dead at a rounded off end, further past 
a few access hatches to the fore of the ship.

Corridor Running Fore and Aft~
   A thin layer of dust lingers over everything, dulling the already dim colors 
of the corridor. The walls are grey, with a slightly raised texture consisting 
of a herringbone pattern on the large, heavy squares that form the interior. A 
different texture to prevent slipping is on the rubberized, dark grey floor and 
contrasts sharply with the white ceiling and bulkheads. This particular 
hallway leads to the aft and fore, and in the latter direction is a clear door 
of some sort.

Just Aft of an Elevator~
   The look of the lightly textured grey walls and rubberized, dark grey floor 
ends at a landing, consistent with the appearance of most of the ship. A thick 
layer of dust and filth has overwhelmed the area, tracks cutting through the 
corridor on what appears to have been a continuous path demonstrating something 
has patrolled here. The wires remain frayed at the top, the electricity on 
this deck appearing to not have been recently renovated. Set in the foreside 
wall is a sliding, thick plastic door that is apparently motorized. Next to it 
is a control console, with four circles each bearing one mark: E, 1, 2, 3, and 
B. Further towards the aft section, the corridor continues, giving little to 
see except more of the same. 
   Marked on the starboard wall in large block letters is: #6"ENGINEERING."

Unsteady Elevator~
   Made of sturdy metal with a see through door, this elevator still feels 
unsteady. It shakes slightly when footsteps are pressed on the blue grey 
carpet lining the bottom. Shadows take over the inside, and it would not 
appear to have power. In the ceiling overhead there is a hatch, with a simple 
latch to keep it closed. With some help, it might be possible to reach it.

Derelict, Shadowy Communications Hub~
   Splaying out from the wall and curving around the room is a communications 
control panel. Considering the small space, it is not very large. A number of 
monitors sit above the console, and a microphone can be seen sturdily connected 
to the center area at the front. Other than that, there are various 
adjustments for channels and presumably the monitors overhead. A layer of dust 
hangs over everything, and some of the panels appear to have been pulled up and 
parts removed.

Near the Bottom of a Ladder Well~
   This rounded, metal tube is a tight fit. It is barely large enough for a 
person to climb up and down the ladder affixed to the left of the blast door. 
Even so, each step is wide, and has texture to allow an easy grip to all but 
the most incapable of individuals. It is rather dusty, and does not appear to 
have been cleaned in a while, yet is far from filthy. 
   Marked on the wall in black paint and block lettering is #6a large letter

A Dusty Control Hub and Access~
   Some of this room remains intact, hollows that might have held displays have 
been left as empty space and a scant few wires. Still, the primary controls 
appear to be largely untouched. Most everything else has been stripped out, 
and neatly so, with no mess. Only dust. This room is fairly expansive, with a 
curving control area. It is also long, and the walls to a keen eye have been 
doubly reinforced. Along the southern wall is a man-sized hatch that is set 
into a recess, a large manual access latch laying across the front of it.

Deck One Ledge in an Elevator Shaft~
   A climb from the slim, narrow ladder down to below puts footing on top of an 
elevator which sits at the bottom of the shaft. It would appear that the 
ladder, however, goes all the way down to the bottom. There are signs that 
this area has been picked over, wires and cables pulled out and away and 
machinery completely missing. The ladder continues to hug the wall, into the 
darkness above and in a space too narrow for human descent below and past the 
elevator. 
   On the wall there is a #6block number one#0 painted in black, the style 
block text.

with four circles each bearing one mark: E, 1, 2, 3, and B. Further towards 
the aft part of the ship the corridor continues, giving little to see in that 
direction except more of the same. 
   Marked on the wall in starkly black block letters, very difficult to miss, 
is: #6"DECK ONE: CRYOGENICS"#0.

Corridor Leading Fore and Aft~
   Large, grey squares held up with white bulkheads make the walls of this 
relatively monotonous corridor. The floor is rubberized and textured, a darker 
shade of grey that appears to have been kept in good condition. Dust covers 
everything, drifting in any light and accumilating in the softly rounded 
corners of the hallway itself.

   Some of the panels have been completely ripped away in this area, leaving 
the hollow skeleton of the frame work. One large, metal square has been left 
off to the side, completely disjointed from the grey wall it was once part of. 
To the aft and fore, the corridor itself continues, mostly uninterrupted unlike 
this part which appears to have been partially stripped.

Intersection of Metalbound Corridors~
   This area is simply a perpendicular convergence of two corridors, crossing 
each other and then leading off in their respective directions. No widening of 
the area is present, though the corners have been rounded rather than jutting 
out at sharp points. The walls are grey in color, with a light texturing in an 
abstract square pattern that is difficult to make out. Likewise, the floor is 
grey, though it is rubberized, textured, and darker than the walls. The 
ceiling and bulkheads are white. 
   Painted on one wall in stark black lettering is #6"DECK ONE: CRYOGENICS"#0.

Port of an Intersection~
   With the intersection on the starboard side, this corridor is comparatively 
less interesting. It is adorned in the manner that is the trademark of this 
particular desk, with grey walls made up of heavy metal squares, textured in a 
herringbone manner and held up by white bulkheads. The floor is laden and 
ingrained with dust throughout the texture, the material rubberized and a 
number of shades darker than the walls. 

"#6HOLDING CELL A#0" marks the fore doorway in black block lettering.

enormous chambers beyond, filled with a number of pods. There are no doors on 
either one, allowing this hallway to seem wider than most of the other regions 
on the deck.

The Port End of a Corridor of Cryogenic Pods~
   A look along to starboard shows little more than a continuing pattern of 
heavy, metal squares painted a flat grey with white bulkheads. All of the 
edges are rounded, lights run near the ceiling, and the floor is a rubberized, 
dark grey material with texture for a good tread. Vague hints of indentions 
that might be doors or other halls are also present. The thick lettering on 
the wall dictates the sector beyond the heavy blast-door as #6"CELL BLOCK A"#0.

it almost like a squashed trapezoid with the ceiling the narrower part. The

heavy metal squares that make up the walls are missing. Underfoot, a darker 
shade of the grey which paints the walls, the floor is rubberized and textured 
for a good grip.

for the layers of dust covering it.

the hallway. The dark shade of grey of the rubberized floor underfoot appears

scrapes present upon the surface. Underfoot, the rubberized floor would almost 
be black in color, if it weren't for the display of accumulated dust on top of 
them.

   The lengthy corridor extends to the port side, the pattern of heavy, metal 
squares painted grey with white bulkheads continuing throughout. All of the 
edges are rounded and lights run along the ceiling in various states of 
disrepair. The floor is a dark grey, rubberized with a texture with good 
tread. Looking far beyond, the indentations of doors can be seen along the 
hallway. The thick lettering on the wall dictates the sector beyond the 
starboard heavy blast-door as "#6CELL BLOCK B#0".

Corridor Running Fore and Aft~
   To the aft and the fore this hall runs, the edges rounded and the shape to 
it almost like a squashed trapezoid with the ceiling the narrower part. The 
lights appear to have been ripped out from near the ceiling, and some of the 
heavy metal squares that make up the walls are missing. Underfoot, a darker 
shade of the grey which paints the walls, the floor is rubberized and textured 
for a good grip.

Fore End of a Corridor~
   The rounded end of this grey corridor has heavy doors in the fore and 
starboard walls. Some of the panels look shredded, wires hanging from gaping 
openings where the thick metal once was. The rubberized floor is a drab color, 
akin to black, if it weren't for the dust and small pieces of debris across the 
textured surface.

Aft End of a Corridor~
   The rounded end of this grey corridor is met with two sturdy sliding doors 
with small barred slits covered in thick plexiglass. Some of the metal plating 
bears gouges in the wall, thick scratches cutting through the surface. Dust 
has covered most of the rubberized ground, swirled over the almost black-hued 
texture.

Corridor Fore and Aft~
   In between an intersection to the fore, and a pair of doors before a 
T-junction to the aft, this stretch of hallway doesn't look special in any 
particular way. Like the rest of the deck, it is made of metal squares, 
painted grey and held up with white bulkheads. Several of them have been torn 
out, and tendrils of wire emerge. It would appear that where there might have 
once been lights near the ceiling, they have been made off with.

Just Fore of a T-Junction~
   Like the rest of the corridors, this area is composed to 
herringbone-textured grey walls, a rubberized darker grey floor with texturing 
to prevent slipping, and a ceiling that match the bulkheads in white. This 
portion, however, allows passage between two blast doors, one on each side. 
Further towards the aftside of the ship is one dimly lit blast door, blocking 
the entirety of the hall. 
   A metal plaque on the starboard door marks it as #6"COMMUNICATIONS"#0 while 
the one on the portside door marks it as #6"EMERGENCY LADDER"#0.

T-Junction in a Corridor~
   Here the continuous grey squares of the hallway branch off, leading 
starboard and port past a blast door which sits blocking any further passage to 
the aft. For the most part, this region appears to not have been cannibalized 
in some way or another. A keen eye, though, would notice that the inert lights 
which should run along near the ceiling are missing. 
   Stark, black block letters mark the wall near the blast door and denote what 
is beyond as: #6"MEDICAL"#0.

area of hallway which leads along through the bowels of the ship. The walls 
have been painted a light grey, the massive metal panels that make up the 
interior held in place with white bulkheads. There is dust all over 
everything, and it's virtually ingrained into the texture of the rubberized, 
dark grey flooring.

completely missing, and all are dim and dull. The grey, heavy panels of metal

rubberized, dark grey walkway which provides a firm footing and muffles 
footsteps. This portion, though, looks just like any other reasonably 
nondescript stretch of hallway. It is grey, made of heavy metal panels and 
roughly a squashed trapezoid in shape with the floor being the wider part.

the control panels on the outside also seem to be intact. In fact, this area 
appears to be almost completely untouched by human hands. It is not, however, 
untouched by dust. 
   There is a plaque on the port door that reads: #6"COOLING UNIT 1"#0. The 
one on the starboard door says: #6"COOLING UNIT 2"#0.

   Without fanfare, though there is a large pit in the floor where some of the

are rounded, taking off any sharp parts should one happen to fall. With the 
rubberized, textured dark grey floor this is somewhat unlikely. The walls are 
grey, and the only thing that appears to have colonized this place in sometimes 
is dust bunnies.

A Deserted Medical Bay~
   Painted a lighter grey than the rest of the deck, this rounded bay is also 
more expansive. Portions remain where equipment has been torn from the walls, 
scraps of wire still hanging from the skeleton of the Ship inside of it. 
Pieces of metal and smashed, unsuable equipment litter the floor in some areas. 
A few alcoves still seem to be somewhat functioning, complete with apparati 
which is intact. Though, here everything is still dark and quiet, a graveyard 
of the occasional overturned gurney.

   Though the air is almost nosebleed dry, this room is quite cool rather than 
seeming warm at all. It is still stuffy and stale, dust cloying the senses and 
settling on gear or exposed skin. A blast door, situated into the foreside 
wall, leaves back to the derelict medical bay. Several shelves span the walls 
around it, devoid of any supplies that might have been here long ago.

Dusty Ladder Well~
   Made of rounded metal plating in a tube shape, this is a tight fit. A 
ladder rises up along the side of it, to the left of a ledge that would just 
allow space enough for maybe two people to stand awkwardly at a time, in front 
of a blast door that swings outwards. The ladder is sturdy, allowing a good 
grip with wide rungs. This entire area has a layer of dust.

floor, is laid on its side and looking somewhat mangled.

   Metal creaks faintly when put under pressure, this shaft leading straight up

good condition. Or, it would if parts did not appear to have been torn away, 
leaving loose wires and and the occasional strip of sharp metal. Dust coats 
everything. Along one wall is a ledge, wide enough for a few people to stand. 
In a cut out at one portion is a metal ladder, leading up and down into 
darkness. 
   Painted on a wall in starkly black block font is a #6number two#0.

   The consistent look of lightly textured cream walls and rubberized, brown 
floor ends at a landing. Set into the foreside wall is a sliding, thick 
plastic door that is apparently motorized. Next to it is a control console, 
with four circles each bearing one mark: E, 1, 2, 3, and B. Further towards 
the aft part of the ship the corridor continues, giving little to see in that 
direction except more of the same.

   Largely untouched by time, this cream-colored hallway continues further to 
the aft side of the ship. It is still and quiet, with no sounds even from 
wildlife echoing down its length. The flooring is rubberized and textured, a 
rich earthen brown in color. Dust hangs over everything, the only marks of 
time long past.

Intersection of Metalbound Corridors~
   This area is simply a perpendicular convergence of two corridors, crossing 
each other and then leading off in their respective directions. No widening of 
the area is present, though the corners have been rounded rather than jutting 
out at sharp points. The walls are cream in color, with a light texturing in 
an abstract square pattern that is difficult to make out. The floor is brown, 
rubberized, textured, and darker than the walls. The ceiling and bulkheads are 
white. 
   Painted in stark black block lettering on one wall is: #6"DECK TWO:

textured for good footing. To the port side, the main intersection of the deck 
can be seen, while the starboard side continues eastwards past a series of 
doors.

door on the starboard side interrupts the corridor, the thick metal remaining 
intact. Bold blocky letters upon the wall, declare this area #6"Sector D"#0.

A Utilitarian Lounge (D-Sector)~
   This medium-sized room is a terse square, the corners rounded to provide 
safer surfaces in the instance of collision. Slats of solid metal and sturdy 
bulkheads compose the walls, painted in the generic cream color present around 
the majority of the ship and flecked with black. A thick layer of dust has 
settled upon everything, enough to mar the topaz hue of the textured and 
rubberized flooring underfoot. A four-cornered metallic object dangles from 
the center of the ceiling, nothing but a fragmented shell with loose wiring 
remaining.

The Remains of a Conference Room (D-Sector)~
   This circular room is bordered by the same cream-toned metal panels that 
adorn most of the ship upon this level. Underfoot, the slate-blue floor 
consists of a rubberized material, cross-hatched for secure travel. Particles 
of dust float about the room, having accumulated in sifting layers that look as 
if they haven't been distrubed in some time. Black scrape marks have been left 
in some areas of the floor and walls, the majority of the furnishings having 
been ripped out some time ago.

The Empty Shell of a Recreation Area~
   This room is pretty much a massive gym, the walls smoothed out and painted a 
cream color. Tiling covers the floor, with pull out portions put away into the 
walls to be slid out and provide extra walls and separate areas for all sorts 
of games. It is really quite empty, with some of the pull outs removed, and 
bins set into the walls completely barren. To the aft is a set of plexiglass 
double doors.

The Western Side of the Community Dorms~
   This massive, rectangular hall is filled with bolted down metal bunks from 
end to end in several rows. It would allow for a large community of people to 
sleep within close conditions. Although some empty spaces remain where it 
appears some furnishings were removed, most of them remain intact and in 
workable conditions.

The Empty Shell of a Lounge~
   This spacious room is almost a perfect square, cream-colored partitions 
separating areas that no longer appear to have any meaning. The dusty floor is 
covered with a layer of shaggy carpet, faded from time to appear a bland beige 
color with black markings along the edge. Catches in the floor and 
square-shaped indentations are the only reminder that this room was ever 
furnished. Bearing no windows, the textured walls are austere and empty.

The Eastern Side of the Community Dorms~
   The entrance of this immense retangular room has been given little room 
before the rows upon rows of bunk-beds start. The furnishings look as if they 
have been entirely bolted down, the space able to likely house hundreds of 
people. Overhead curtain rods lay empty, a few bearing small metal rings which 
may have served as a makeshift partition between sleeping areas. Layers of 
dust has settled over everything, encasing the rubberized flooring across the 
room.

   Rounded corners protect the edges of this rectangular room, the 
enamel-coated walls the same generic color seen along the majority of the deck 
itself. Dust has wedged itself in the threads of the thick carpet underfoot, 
polluting the light beige coloring with a gritty brown. The remnants of a 
table in the corner are empty, loose bolts tilting it at a lopsided angle. A 
few frayed wires dangle from where something was ripped out of a nearby wall.

of the others. Heavy canisters block most of the aft wall, locked up behind a 
metal grating that provides access only to the individual gauges placed on each 
one. A faint hum seems present within the area itself, focused on some of the 
complex apparati connected to dusty instrumentation panels.

Along a Corridor Starboard of a Blast-Door~
   The heavy cream-colored squares along the long corridor walls are patterned 
with a subtle herringbone surface, giving it a machined look. A few of them 
hang unsecured off the sides, revealing scant glimpses at the sturdy metal 
sheeting of which they are composed. Dust has settled upon the earthen brown 
floor in thick layers, residing in the textured recesses of the rubberized 
materials. Large blocky letters read #6"A-Sector"#0, the paint still legible 
despite time. 

A plaque on the aft door reads: #6"LIFE SUPPORT - AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY."

bulkheads compose the walls, painted in the generic cream color present around

the center of the ceiling, nothing but a fragmented shell with loose wiring 
remaining.

Rectangular sections of mirrors coated in a clear protective layer is flush

   A tiered, rounded room sweeps away in several portions of tiers that each

of the floor is covered in a short, grey carpet which contrasts with the cream 
walls. Areas of it have been ripped up, as if where furniture bolted down has 
been torn away. Empty alcoves gape in the walls, with the remains of a few 
wires here and there dangling out.

rounded. A series of sliding doors each feature a #2small chrion plaque#0.

The Derelict Remains of a Conference Hall~
   The walls of this large, rectangular room taper off into an oval shape at 
the ceiling. The rubberized floor is textured for traction, the earthen brown 
material still secure despite the scuffs across it where heavy objects were 
dragged out. Whatever once adorned this hall have since been removed, leaving 
nothing but a large and unfurnished space. The metal panels of the ceiling 
mostly appear to be intact, although the welding does seem to be weaker in a 
few areas.

A Large, Desolate Messhall~
   Tiled on the floor, instead of the usual textured material, this room is 
rather larger than the corridors just outside. It is still composed of 
cream-painted metal squares, the ceiling not any higher, but there is 
definitely more floor space. It is also very empty, with a few metal counters 
set up, though portions of the flooring have been torn away as if there was 
more prior. Another blast door leads further to the aft, while the one to the 
fore leads back to the corridor. 
   A few panels along the walls, especially the back one, appear to have been 
pulled open and stripped. Pieces of the floor are in a similar state, with now 
derelict pipes and remnants of wires and cables exposed.

made up of heavy squares with a herringbone texture, held in place by white 
bulkheads. Much of the corners have been rounded, leaving few if any sharp 
edges. Just further to the aft, before another door, the corridor branches off 
to starboard and port. 
   A metal plaque on the starboard door marks it as #6"COMMUNICATIONS"#0 while 
the one on the portside door marks it as #6"EMERGENCY LADDER"#0.

Third Level of a Ladder Well~
   The rounded metal tube that is the stairwell continues up and down into 
darkness, with only enough space for a ladder to the left of a ledge and one 
human. Maybe on the ledge there would be enough space for two people, in 
addition to a blast door that swings outwards. Sturdy rungs with excellent 
texture for gripping make up the ladder.

floor. Dominating the northern wall is the remains of a video monitoring 
framework, the screens themselves having been broken to unusable states or 
ripped out with only impossibly stripped wiring hanging out of empty holes. A 
U-shaped desk is bolted upon the eastern side, deep scrapes permanently 
indented in the polyplastic coating where equipment was forcibly removed.

bulkheads compose the walls, painted in the generic cream color present around

remaining.

The Fore Side of a Corridor of Doors~
   This is the beginning of a corridor of doors leading further oft to the aft, 
the cream color interspersed with black flecks. Rubberized flooring provides a 
firm grip to any shoes, colored a topaz-yellow. Far to the aft. Dust has 
settled over the hallway in swirled layers, creating a long, desolate expanse.

Along a Corridor of Doors~
   The sliding doors, painted in cream to match the walls and offset by the 
rich topaz hue of the rubberized floor continue through here. Some areas 
appear to have been torn apart, with panels pulled down to expose the inner 
workings of the ship. Dust drifts lazily in the dry air, which is almost 
oppressive in its staleness.

   At the end of the corridor are two more doors, set up opposite each other to 
slide into the cream walls which they match. On the aft side, a more 
pronounced door marks the end of the hallway. Black flecks intersperse 
throughout the cream, constrating with the topaz-yellow of the rubberized 
floor. All the corners have been rounded, keeping the corners smoothed out and 
more non-lethal should one happen to fall into them.

Corridor Starboard of a T-Junction~
   The cream-painted corridor is interrupted by a heavy blast door against the 
starboard side. Rubberized, earthen brown flooring runs the length of the 
hallway, while rounded corners provide a feature of safety. To the port side, 
a T-intersection can be seen. Dust litters the area in a heavy coating, 
partially concealing the bold lettering on the wall pronouncing #6"C-Sector"#0.

A Utilitarian Lounge (C-Sector)~
   This medium-sized room is a terse square, the corners rounded to provide 
safer surfaces in the instance of collision. Slats of solid metal and sturdy 
bulkheads compose the walls, painted in the generic cream color present around 
the majority of the ship and flecked with black. A thick layer of dust has 
settled upon everything, enough to mar the dark red hue of the textured and 
rubberized flooring underfoot. A four-cornered metallic object dangles from 
the center of the ceiling, nothing but a fragmented shell with loose wiring 
remaining.

A Circular, Gun-Black Chamber~
   Completely composed of smooth gun-black metal, this circular chamber is a 
far cry from the typical interior decoration on board this ship. The chamber 
is two-tiered, with an ascending platform above. The top tier's walls are 
lined with numerous machines and panels, all around the circumference of the 
area. On the lower tier sits a lone, smooth, featureless #3pillar#0 in the 
centre. A cold draft appears to sweep through this room, leaving one's breath 
misty.

Empty Remains of a Kitchen~
   Far from being spacious, this room is just metal like the rest of the ship. 
It is painted cream, with stainless steel counters surrounding the edge of the 
room. Some portions are visible where it appears various cooking equipment has 
been ripped out. One region shows the exposed remains of plumbing and internal 
workings of the Ship.

Deck Three Ledge in an Elevator Shaft~
   Panels have been pulled aside, and the wiring removed in various places 
along the elevator shaft. One such one sits next to the door towards the aft 
of the portion, the doors left slightly ajar with the potential to be pried 
open. A ledge surrounds them, allowing cramped space for people to stand, 
while a cut out allows a slender ladder to continue above and below. 
   Painted on the wall in black and block text is a #6number three#0.

Just Aft of an Elevator~
   The consistent look of lightly textured white walls and rubberized, dark 
grey floor ends at a landing. Set into the foreside wall is a sliding, thick 
plastic door that is apparently motorized. Next to it is a control console, 
with four circles each bearing one mark: E, 1, 2, 3, and B. Further towards 
the aft part of the ship, the corridor continues, giving little to see in that 
direction except more of the same. On the wall in large, black block letters 
is: #6"DECK THREE: PROFESSIONS SECTOR"#0. 
   There is a slightly astringent smell of chemicals seeming to originate from 
behind the doors lining the starboard and port sides. Bulky #2biometric 
scanners#0 appear to be installed along the metal-plated walls, one beside each 
door.

   While a more advanced piece of technology, the bulky size and rounded shape of these dual-purpose scanners give the impression it is an outdated version. A biometric thumbprint allows  programmed sector leadership to #6LOCK#0 and #6UNLOCK#0 their #6CLOTH#0 or #6METAL#0 firebreathers at will. For all others, when the door is locked, there is a light-blue biometric handscanning pad for those with authorization.

According to the small plaques on either wall, when the doors are locked:
#6HANDSCAN WEST#0 for the Metal Firebreather (Sector A).
#6HANDSCAN EAST#0 for the Cloth Firebreather (Sector B).

Corridor Running Fore and Aft~
   Continuing on between fore and aft uninterrupted, the sides of this hallway 
are painted white, though they are covered in dust. Each one is made up of 
heavy metal squares textured in a herringbone pattern, sturdily held into 
place. The floor, by contrast, is a dark grey, rubberized and textured surface 
allowing a good grip. 
   The stench of chemicals seems to be trickling in from the port and starboard 
doors. Beside each one, bulky #2biometric scanners#0 appear to be installed 
along the metal-plated walls.

Fore of an Intersection~
   Just to the aft of here, the rounded corners give way to an intersection 
leading in the four main directions. The walls are white and dusty, made of 
heavy metal squares with a light herringbone texture and held in place by 
bulkheads. It is reasonably quiet, most sounds the occasional shift of 
something far off, or a dull thump. Footsteps are muffled by the rubberized 
texture of the floor.

Intersection of Metalbound Corridors~
   This area is simply a perpendicular convergence of two corridors, crossing 
each other and then leading off in their respective directions. No widening of 
the area is present, though the corners have been rounded rather than jutting 
out at sharp points. The walls are a bright but dusty white, with light 
herringbone texturing on the large, square panels that is difficult to make 
out. The floor is nearly black and a rubberized, textured material. Painted 
on one wall in stark black is the lettering: #6"DECK THREE: PROFESSIONAL

herringbone pattern underneath the surprisingly resilient paint.

   Interrupted by mechanized bay doors on the aft and fore parts of the 
hallway, the pattern of heavy herringbone-textured white squares continues to 
make up the walls. There is a tiled portion that interrupts the rubberized 
material of the floor, flat and smooth and leading between the two fairly wide 
entryways. Further off to port, the hallway continues, before eventually 
meeting a T-junction. 
   The fore bay doors are marked with the #6motif of a caudeceus superimposed

settle in layers over the rubberized floor.

   A fair-sized room considering the dimensions of the ship, this office has a 
floor of smooth, oversized tiles with a circular golden-toned rug centered upon 
it. Long scuffs and scrapes have left black blemishes across the surface 
underfoot, but as a whole, the majority of dust looks to have been almost 
obsessively eliminated. The square metal-panels of the wall are a simple beige 
tone, several slanted from loose welding. Pull-down alcoves installed into the

   The white, heavy metal squares of this hallway run past two strong bay doors 
that slide open on either side of the dark grey, rubberized walkway. Some of 
the panels along the corridor appear to have been pulled apart, a few of the

   With rounded corners, the corridor turns into a space heading aft and fore 
with the same rubberized, textured walkway underfoot. The walls have been 
painted white, and are made of heavy metal squares with a herringbone texture. 
The bulkheads and ceiling are much the same color. Directly at the end is an 
unpainted blast door.

Corridor Running Fore and Aft~
   Leading away from the T-junction, the corridor continues more towards the 
fore of the ship. It is quiet, except for the occasional clunk, and the 
distant sounds of something settling. The white-painted metal squares of the 
walls are covered in a thin layer of dust, as is the rubberized, textured and 
dark grey walkway underfoot. A few portions appear to have been opened up, and 
the inner machinery torn away.

Fore End of a Corridor~
   The white-painted hallway ends in a rounded off section beside a door, the 
metal panels dulled from accumulated dirt and dust. The rubberized floor is 
marked with a few scuffs and scrapes across the thick, dark-grey surface. 
Close examination might reveal a few loosely welded panels in the ceiling, the 
weight alone holding it into place. 
   Along the starboard side, the sliding door is recessed into the wall, 
emblazoned with the aged image of a golden man holding up a globe. Appearing 
more recently installed is a #3small etched plaque#0 and an #2advanced

A Renovated Office (Crafting Sector)~
   A fair sized space considering the dimensions of the ship, this room has a 
floor of flat, smooth tile. The center of the tiled floor has been artfully 
covered up with a geometric-patterned jewel-toned rug, matching the 
wall-hangings that drape and soften the square metal-paneled walls. The 
wall-hangings are simple bolts of amethyst, ruby red, and sapphire blue cloth, 
flounced and pinned into pleats here and there. Desks and easels flank the 
walls, overflowing with plastic blueprints and patterns. Sculptures clutter 
the surfaces even more, bits of cloth hanging off of them. An #2advanced

   The lengthy corridor terminates in a rounded dead end, the corners having 
been softly rounded. It is a fairly cramped section, though it might offer 
enough space for a few people to stand comfortably. The dark grey floor is the 
same rubberized material as much of the rest of the deck, the hue altered by 
the quantity of dust littering the ground. 
   Recessed and still functional, a sliding door is installed upon the 
starboard side near a #3small etched plaque#0 and an #2advanced card-scanning

holding up a grey globe, though time has begun to eat away at the enamel.

A Renovated Office (Technical Sector)~
   Considering the dimensions of the ship, this renovated office is a 
fair-sized space. The desk itself has been pushed towards the door itself, 
leaving little space for other guests to roam around in. Long, chrion tables 
line the starboard perimeter, littered with numerous electronic devices and 
robotic gadgets, in varying states of completion. Loose wires, processor chips 
and small bits of metal and plastic abound in unlabeled crates, adding to the 
general disarray. The flat, smooth tiles are a stark white color, mostly 
cleaned up of lingering dust and dirt. Panelled walls of metal sheets are 
mostly bare, a few angled blueprints and technical data hastily posted up on 
the far wall. An #2advanced card-scanning unit#0 has been installed beside the 
sliding door leading back into the corridor.

painted a drab white color, partially disgusing the heavy metal panels that

   The port side of this crafting hall is shaped into a rectangular, the 
corners all softened and rounded off. Shelves that once lined this area have 
been long ago ripped off, a few jutting metal shards left protruding from the 
walls as a placeholder. The metal-panelled walls are coated in a white enamel 
polymer, dusted over with a thin layer of soot. The rubberized floor is 
textured for traction, the grey surface grimy and scuffed.

scrapes left where shelves were ripped off their brackets. Aside from the dust 
that coats the floor, what appears to have been soot has blackened the upper 
ceiling. Bearing a heavy traction, the dark grey floor is made of a rubber 
composite. The floor appears to have been torn up some in one specific spot, 
as though a large piece of machinery was peeled and yanked from the floor and 
dragged away.

the walls, and the room stretches further to both port and starboard. Here the

no more so than in the vicinity of the treatment area. The hypoallergenic 
plinths are tidy and aseptic. Curved rails have been mounted to the ceiling, 
creating a frame from which curtains once hung around the beds. Bay doors 
enclose the area on all sides, excepting an open archway to the fore.

plastic into the shattered tile floors. Glass and chemicals litter the floor, 
the latter giving off a horrible mingled stench. The colors were once cream

Panels that had been removed from the ceiling have brought the explosion up

a few other items. There are also stainless steel cabinets, and it looks as if 
the lights have been torn out overhead. It is a fairly small room, but still 
provides a decent amount of workspace. A blast door leads back to the mess. 
   The port section of the room has been bowed out into a curve, the edges all

but currently they are blocked off.

   The corridor ends. There is no fanfare about it, just a rounded off stub of 
where it might have further continued. White walls close in all around, except 
back to the fore, and the dark grey floor stops, too. A few old marks mar the 
wall, as if something had scraped along them, and a vent can be seen overhead.

Center of a Hydroponics Lab~
   Away from the doorway is a series of sectioned off tiers, arranged in the 
manner of a series of climate-controlled cubicles, starting at floor level and 
going up high enough to give a fairly tall person just enough space to walk. 
They span around this oblong-shaped room, filled with a number of old troughs 
and plastic slide away cubbies for things to be put. Everything is covered in 
a layer of dust.

devoid of life, and heavily laden with dust. A bunch of the machinery has been 
ripped out of the walls, and the various arrays around. Pieces of broken down

Port of a T-Junction~
   Leading away from the T-junction further starboard, the corridor continues 
on formed of heavy, herringbone-textured squares painted in a bright but now 
dusty white. The floor appears to be in very good repair, all told, with the 
rubberized, dark grey flooring only seeming to have dust on it after all these 
years and no cracks to speak of. Further port is another turn.

uninterrupted. Quiet as a tomb, and a continuing hall of herringbone-textured, 
white-painted metal squares. The flooring is likewise uninterrupted, just the 
textured, dark grey and rubberized material that runs underfoot. There are 
some recessions further to the aft.

   Into each recession alongside this stretch of ship hallway is a door, clear 
and allowing a look to the room beyond. The doors themselves slide into the 
white-painted walls on mechanisms, hiding away beyond. Corners have been 
rounded off, keeping this area reasonably safe from any potential jarring into 
sharp edges. It would appear that the doors are bullet proof glass. 
   Painted on the glass of the portside door is #6"HYDROPONICS FOUR"#0 and the 
starboard door is likewise marked with #6"HYDROPONICS THREE"#0.

there's little of interest to see, except some portions of the floor that have

Top Ledge of an Elevator Shaft~
   A lip surrounds a pair of doors, supplying a ledge for several people to 
stand; albeit precariously. Along one side is a cut out, in which a slim metal 
ladder descends into the inky blackness below. Rust shows on the walls, as 
does dust, and the metal occasionally creaks. Sounds of something settling can 
be heard echoing muffledly. 
   Painted on the wall in stark black is a #6block letter B#0.

Just Aft of an Elevator~
   The corridor opens up to a landing, allowing more and slightly rounded 
space, as opposed to the straight and astere lines that make up the rest of the 
area. Still, the same geometrically textured grey walls and the rubberized, 
dark grey floor remain. To the fore is a sliding door, the space beyond thick, 
transparent glass visible. Off to one side is a series of round, circular 
lights: E, 1, 2, 3, and B. These make up part of what would appear to be a 
slick control panel. 
   Marked in the wall in very large and starkly black block letters leading up 
to the ceiling is: #6"EMERGENCY HATCH"#0.

Wide Corridor Running Fore and Aft~
   Continuing away from the elevator in one direction, and the golden-marked 
doors in the other, this corridor has little of note about it. It is wide 
enough to allow the passage of several people along a rubberized, blue grey 
floor. The walls are made up of heavy, metal squares with a herringbone 
texture and pale grey paint. They are held in place by brilliantly white 
bulkheads which match the ceiling. To port, there is a heavy door inset into 
the wall, dented and unable to close entirely, with several warnings etched 
onto the surface. Above the door has been stenciled, #6"AIRLOCK"#0.

Wide Corridor, to the Fore and Aft~
   Onwards continues the corridor that is large enough for more than several 
people to pass each other, giving a much roomier feel than the rest of the 
ship. Rubberized flooring in a dark blue-grey is underfoot, standing out 
compared to the pale grey of the walls or the white of the bulkheads and 
ceiling. A layer of dust and dirt has accumulated here, gathering in larger 
amounts where it has been tracked in the direction of the blast doors to either 
side. 
   Beside the starboard door are black block letters reading #6"OPEN MARKET"#0, 
looking to have been painted on more recently than some of the rest of the 
markings of the ship. The port doorway is labeled with aged black words, the 
lettering fading, #6"CREW LOUNGE"#0.

Wide Corridor Between Two Doors~
   Comfortably wide, this hallway runs between the fore and aft sections of the 
ship. The bolted metal walls are painted a pale grey, and the rubberized 
flooring is a darker blue grey. Here the passage goes between two doors. One 
is a painted, heavy metal door that slides away into the wall. The other is 
marked with a greyish globe, held up by a rather muscular golden man. 
Underneath is an insignia of parallel, vertical golden bars. 
   Metal plaques are situated on the wall next to each door. The one for the 
starboard door reads #6"CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS"#0 while the one to port reads 
#6"OBSERVATION LOUNGE"#0.

appear almost completely smooth, and painted white; tapping on them would

else. A small #6panel#0 has been revealed off to the side of the doorway 
leading back into the hall.

Neat, Stately Office~
   This rectangular room has a crisp and formal feel, created seemingly moreso 
by the needs and habits of its user than by a conscious effort to achieve this 
atmosphere. The inventory is sparse but tidy, the majority located towards one 
end and centered around the desk so as to leave ample room for multiple people 
to stand before it. A control panel occupies a section of the wall to the 
right of said desk while a sleek screen with a digitalized map of the solar 
system extends seamlessly from the wall to the left. A thin, utilitarian 
carpet of dark grey fabric covers the floor, embossed with an orange phoenix in 
a slightly thicker weave that spreads its wings majestically before the desk. 
This seems to be a more recent addition, as is the mainframe that looms beside 
the door in the back of the office, looking somewhat less complicated and out 
of place among the much more advanced technology flanking the desk.

Oblong Captain's Quarters~
   Contrasting somewhat with the adjacent office, this bedroom has a much more 
private appearance. A bed occupies the far corner, comfortable but not 
excessive, and other accessories typical of a busy person's private quarters 
take up space here and there. The room is oblong and the end has been 
sectioned by a sliding panel that lends additional privacy despite not fully 
closing that section off. The herringbone wall-pattern gives way to a large, 
square window with rounded corners, providing vision into the vastness beyond.

Wide Corridor Passing Between Rooms~
   Comfortably large enough for several people to pass through, this corridor 
runs fore to the aft of the ship, where it terminates in doors that can be 
glimpsed at a distance on either end. The walls have been painted a pale grey, 
and the rubberized flooring is a dark blue-grey that contrasts sharply. On 
either side is a blast door, closing off other portions of the deck. 
   Metal plaques next to each door describe what is inside. The starboard has 
one marked #6"PRIMARY COMMUNICATIONS"#0 while the one on the opposite side of 
the hall is #6"EMERGENCY LADDER"#0.

apparati for security beside it. It parts down the middle, in the center of an 
icon that is a golden man holding up a grey globe. To either side are other 
doors, less ornate than the one directly to the aft. The rest of the corridor 
is painted a pale grey, and the rubberized flooring is a dark blue grey. 
   Each door is marked with a plaque. The one on starboard side is #6"READY

A Clean, Empty Tiered Cavern of a Room~
   This room is arranged in a half-circle, with a series of perhaps seven tiers 
surrounding a space at the center portside of the area. In that portion there 
are some loose wires, and panels in the floor appear to have been torn up. 
Likewise with several other regions, including a counter-top that curves at the 
front of every tier. The door opens on the top middle of the tier, at a 
stairway which descends straight through the center. The room itself seems 
clean, with few - if any - traces of dust or grime present.

Forlorn Remains of a Lounge~
   This curved, cream-painted room is almost conspicuously empty. It is even 
clean, except for the dust that hangs over absolutely everything. No litter is 
to be seen, and portions amid the floor have been ripped up. What remains of a 
homey brown carpet is fairly shredded, even if mostly intact. Displays along 
the walls that might have once held something are missing any glass, or 
anything inside. A sliding door leads back to the hallway.

Enormous, Egg-Shaped Expanse of a Dusty Bridge~
   This space is circular in shape with a massive, heavily-secured door 
standing to the stern. Metal-clad stairs lead down into the main area, 
trailing into an inset platform, where a single massive command-chair rests. 
The cushioning of the chair seems to be made of a deep-blue gel material, 
glowing faintly. The stairs continues around the inset platform, leading to a 
small ampetheatrk-like section. Every few feet, long-defunct computer stations 
rest idle, small padded chairs sitting alone before each one. To the side of 
the heavily-secured door begins an upper metal-grated deck, a walkway guarding 
the delicate machines humming beneath that stretches all the way around the 
room, meeting back up with the doorway. To either side of the entrance are 
large green-tinted panels of glass, faint tracings of whatever was once upon 
them still glowing. The beams above loom like a metallic ribcage, offering 
protection, design aesthetic, and support. Overlooking the entire room stands 
a massive panel of clear-polyprop, wrapping from one side of the bridge to the 
other, only darkness standing beyond. Over every surface a thick layer of dust 
has collected, rising if disturbed.

Door on a Cramped, Cold Walkway~
   Like the rest of the ship, the walls of the exterior of this portion are 
grey metal panels with a herringbone pattern, held in place by white bulkheads. 
The floor is also dark grey, rubberized material. The panels in the center of 
the room, however, are smooth alloy of some sort and play host to a number of 
displays. No inputs appear to be on this part. It is surprisingly cold, 
though touching the sequestered portion in the middle reveals it to be warm to 
the touch, about the temperature level of human skin. Still, tiny ice crystals

Corner on a Cramped, Cold Walkway~
   This walkway, which matches the corridors outside on the right hand side, is 
considerably cramped. There is only enough room for one person to really walk 
through at a time, comfortably. On the lefthand side is a structure of some 
sort of alloy, with a matte and slightly pebbled finish to it, interrupted on 
occasion with a few vents and well-guarded fans. When touched, unlike the 
chilly air in the room, it gives off warmth that is readily comfortable against 
bare skin.

   Indented into the structure the walkway surrounds, this space is still 
cramped, but allows a little breathing room. A console with a keyboard, a 
number of input devices, and several screens reading off various diagnostics 
surround it. On one side is a panel with a pair of hand-shaped indentions. 
Like the rest of this portion of the ship, the area is cold, but the machinery 
is surprisingly warm to the touch. 
   On one part of the area is a large panel with a small handle that it would 
be possible to slide to the side and #6look#0 through the #6window#0 behind it.

Corner of a Cramped, Cold Walkway~
   Only wide enough for people to walk through single file comfortably, and 
even then not long enough to house those who are claustrophobic, the walkway 
continues around the warm, rectangular structure in the center. It is largely 
featureless, except for the occasional vent or fan. Ice crystals form on the 
walls surrounding the structure, but not the matrix itself. Small droplets of 
condensation can be seen here and there, and mist drifts along the rubberized 
floor.

around the floor, and a faint woosh of air can be heard and felt somewhere 
overhead. It's quite cold, with small ice crystals forming on the wall not

   Only big enough for one person to walk, or a single file line to proceed, 
this claustrophobic space moves at a corner past the rectangular structure in 
the center which bears a number of grates and fans. Warmer air intermixes with 
the chillingly cold of the rest of the chamber, making a thin layer of mist 
hang over the entire area. Other than that, and the structure in the center, 
the walls to the right look like the rest of the ship.

Door on a Cramped, Cold Walkway~
   Like the rest of the ship, the walls of the exterior of this portion are 
grey metal panels with a herringbone pattern, held in place by white bulkheads. 
The floor is also dark grey, rubberized material. The panels in the center of 
the room, however, are smooth alloy of some sort and play host to a number of 
displays. No inputs appear to be on this part. It is surprisingly cold, 
though touching the sequestered portion in the middle reveals it to be warm to 
the touch, about the temperature level of human skin. Still, tiny ice crystals 
encrust the walkway and outer walls, and mist rolls around the floor. 
   Marked on a clear space of lightly textured greyish paneling is a large,

A Humongous, Blue-lit Chamber~
   After a descent from the access hatch set on the fore wall, it is possible 
to reach the floor of this enormous room. It is undecorated, as far as the eye 
can see, and completely lit with a faint blue light that plays havoc on the 
eyes. The most obvious thing is a currently quiet engine core, settled in the 
bowels of the ship and hooked into everything. Everything that can be seen in 
the form of utilities connects to this, though some regions appear to have been 
severed. At one point, towards the center of the room and before the core, is 
a square console with little of note about it. It is conspicuously quiet, 
almost deathly so.

   Footsteps through this corridor would be muffled by the earthen brown, 
rubberized floor. There is no interruption to the monotonous pattern of the 
heavy, herringbone-textured squares that make up the cream-painted walls. 
Further on to the aft, there appears to be two doors pressed into the sides, 
while the main intersection stands visible to the fore.

Cramped Walkway at a Recessed Control Hub~
   After a climb through the access hatch and up a ladder, there is a small 
control region. Most of it would appear to be defunct, pieces torn away. 
However, the primary controls are intact, even if the display would appear to 
be disconnected. All around the area are a number of vaguely luminescent 
pipes, more portions recessed into the walls. It might be possible to squeeze 
through, and access further through crawl space. The floor is a rubberized, 
dark grey material which lends a good grip.

Cramped Walkway Along a Humming Apparatus~
   Pieces of machinery are absent, though there are still some luminescent 
tubes. Most of this area is acquiescent, as if on some form of standby or 
backup. Entire chunks of wiring have been pulled away, and a few metal panels 
appear to be loose - or just gone. The walkway leads back to a control hub.

Alcove-Lined Chamber~
   This room is larger than the others, vaulted high overhead. A number of 
mostly intact controls line the walls, as do several other things. In apparati 
that can seemingly be removed with some work to it, are a number of tanks. It 
is difficult to get a look at them, and they are all locked in places. A faint 
hum can be heard, and tubes line wherever the tanks are not.

Expansive, Pod-Filled Chamber~
   Immense and stretching to starboard and port, away from the metal archway 
which leads to back to the hall, this chamber is taller than practically any on 
the deck. A number of smaller alcoves line the walls, marked with numbers on 
the glass outside of the rough egg shapes. They fill the room, perhaps upwards 
to hundreds of them, all acquiescent and dim in the darkness. At one point is 
a locked off area, and there is the occasional derelict, rolling gurney left 
around.

A Lengthy Corridor of Dormitories~
   Sliding doors are installed along both sides of this lengthy corridor, 
painted a cream-colored tone flecked with black that matches the panelled 
walls. Textured with a cross-hatched pattern for improved traction, the 
rubberized floor is a steel-grey color. Layers of dust have gathered from 
disuse, stirred up easily upon movement.

A Corridor of Sliding Doors~
   On the reverse side of a heavy blast door, this lengthy hallway runs 
interrupted only by sliding doors on the aft and fore sides. The textured 
floor is of a thick rubberized material, a commercial slate-blue color from end 
to end. There's a stale odor present throughout the area, furthered by the 
lingering dust that has settled over everything.

Organic Artificial Intelligence Matrix~
   Past the covered window is a vaguely luminescent vat of clouded, colorless 
liquid inside, the interior lined with a number of electronic apparati past the 
cloudy fluid. At some points it crisscrosses, forming a network of tiny wires 
or microcomponents, but it appears most of them are in the walls of the 
chamber. Some of them flash, and there are small light displays along the 
walls, along with sensors and various other equipment.

An Immense, Recessed Entryway~
   Built at a slight downward slope and set into the very earth of the 
Junkyard, this room is immense and long. The walls are made of vaulted metal 
and polycrete, tapering up to arches overhead, inlaid into the ceiling. This 
itself departs from the general grey of the room, of which polished basalt rock 
makes up the floor, bonded in areas with metal. A number of panes forms it, 
allowing light to filter in or the stars to be seen through them. They are 
cracked and encrusted with the lunar dust over time, and some areas seem to 
have been worn through completely. Sound echoes very clearly in here. 
   Along one wall has been painted, in an almost childlike scribble: #1"Ehts 
raining ehts pourin deh old man is snorin."#0

An Inert Slope into a Checkpoint~
   At the base of an immense, sloping ramp that rises to the west, the passage 
is constricted by two basalt counters bolted to the floor. Jagged transparent 
plexiglass lines their front edge, shattered long ago. The metal and polycrete 
walls continue, burnished to a glasslike sheen by some damage and laced with a 
myriad of cracks. Shadows of men, stretched and elongated towards the ceiling, 
remain in permanent relief upon the walls, their limbs and posture in poses of 
action, as if reaching for side-mounted weapons. 
   The graffiti continues about the walls, all in black and white paint except 
for a line of bleeding red which reads: #1"He went to bed and bumped is ead and 
couldn get up in da mornin."#0

A Passage of Former Opulence~
   Slick floors of polished basalt continue, sloping faintly as they continue 
east and downward. The metal beams supporting the polycrete of the walls still 
gleam, reflecting light diffusely in all directions as they are illuminated. 
Swaths of rust-colored stain mar the complexion of every surface, splattered 
without pattern or purpose. A chill rises like an exhalation from below, 
making this area feel cold even in the heat of the Lunar day. At the east end 
of the tunnel rises the shattered and jagged teeth of what was a plexiglass 
wall, shards lying in pieces about the floor.

An Evicerated Utility Room~
   Lining the wall are rusted husks of piping leading in all directions but 
what would be expected. Upon closer inspection the pipes cross-cut about one 
another in weaved fashion and instead of running into the walls toward the 
other rooms, they create a cycle by winding into themselves. In the room is a 
series of control panels that have been put into disarray, torn asunder by 
countless exploits for their parts. A soft flicker of light in the panels 
casts a strobing shadow of its carcass that barely reaches just far enough to 
flash against a column. The pillar separates a row of lockers from the rest of 
the room, all of which empty and show an aversion of drab color; their doors 
dented and mangled.

A Monolithic Lift~
   This room comprises of a lift that still seems functional and untouched, 
remaining solidly in one piece. In contrast to the corridors leading 
downwards, this area is utilitarian: metal beams along the grey polycrete walls 
offer no manner of elegance. The lift's flooring is devoid of color, left in 
its flat plane of mixed polycrete and alloy supports that have been woven into 
its entirety. Along the walls are indented pillars that jut from the walls, 
providing the lift's tram-like guidance. Below lies a void of black that 
suggests an ostensibly endless distance toward the lift's bottom.

   A vaulted room of austere decoration, this place was once built for function 
over form, but now barely holds together. Chunks of the ceiling collapse 
inward under the weight of the rubble above, and the entire facility groans 
with the stress of remaining sound. Cabling and piping covers the walls, 
crates stored here for a time of need now sodden and rotted. Robots, 
electronics, and sensitive scientific equipment now stand half-exposed, their 
crate housings collapsed, their components likely ruined.

Narrow, Precarious Catwalk~
   Away from a massive lift leads a rusted, precarious walk which stretches 
over an expanse of hungry blackness below. The interlocking metal grating 
provides an excellent look at this. Above, supports holding up the earth and 
innumerable pieces of wreckage form the ceiling of the cave. Across the rift 
of darkness the catwalk stretches out to the side of an absolutely enormous 
metal structure. It disappears into the deeps, and on one side can be seen the 
scratched and faded emblem of a golden man holding up a grey globe. 
   What little air there would seem to be here is stale and dry, nosebleed 
inducing. The supported refuse overhead seems to close in, and the blackness 
beneath stretches on out of sight.

Aerie Atop of a Massive, Sand-Covered Ship~
   Portions of the outer hull of the ship have been stripped away, leaving 
gouges and dents in the top of the metallic behemoth. The sides of the ship 
curve away, plummeting towards the area below. A look over the side shows the 
rocky red bluff the SBS Atlas is perched on top of, and past that the swirling, 
red deserts of Mars. This is the entire length of the outer ship, stretching 
for a great ways and crafting a relatively flat surface.

   A control panel has been set into the aftward wall, complete and whole, 
though covered in a thick layer of dust. Around it rise the looming shapes of 
pipes, vents, wires, and the other internal workings of such a massive bit of 
machinery. Ladders allow access to ledges, in which there are alcoves that 
slide out of the walls.

Falling Into Inky Blackness~
   Whatever possessed you to do so, you have stepped off of one of the missing 
portions of the catwalk. The more instinctual part of the brain, that is 
likely to keep you alive in such endeavours, immediately fires in alarm to 
inform you of what a #1bad#0 idea this was. It's only a split second, though, 
and then you plummet down, down, down into the blackness below. The catwalk is 
more like a memory as you speed by the massive shape of the spaceship further 
to the west, far beyond your reach.

Continuing to Fall through Blackness~
   Your potentially unplanned trip continues as you fall further into the 
darkness, now surrounded by nothing more than stale air which whips past your 
ragdoll body and the consuming dark that makes up the humongous cave. No end 
is in sight, but then again, not much else is either.

In Mid-Air, Falling in Darkness~
   It is black, black, and the air seems torn away from your lungs with the 
speed you're moving at. It leaves you breathless, dust cloying your senses 
from the long period of disuse of this area. Nothing is in sight, not the 
catwalk from above, or whatever might be at the bottom of this area. You think 
you can make out the faint gleam of something metallic off to the west.

Long Fall, Past a Massive Ship~
   Light, by whatever might have grown up in this frosty and enormous tomb, 
provide some illumination of the hulking metal spaceship to the west. It may 
be that you have enough mental presence to notice such a thing, as you plummet 
to your doom. On the side of it is the painting of a golden man, holding up a 
grey globe on his corded shoulders. If only someone would hold you up now, as 
you keep falling...

An Abrupt Stop, on Jagged Rocks~
   Here, your impromptu journey ends. Rather suddenly, in fact, with the 
jagged pieces of moon rock at the bottom of the chasm. They rip into your body 
and shatter your bones, sending blood spurting out of torn vessels to splatter 
all over the area. As you lay dying, you might have a precious few seconds to 
vaguely wonder if it was worth it.

Shattered Office~
   This ruined office is little more than a corner cubicle, a faux-wood door 
standing at the northern end of the cramped space. A small computer 
workstation stands in the corner, battered and broken, while wires hang from 
the exposed ceiling tiles. A painting on the far wall depicts #3a resplendent 
golden man#0 standing atop a globe. The southern wall of the room has been 
caved in, rubble strewn about. Wires hang thickly over the crude entrance.

The Dust-Covered Back Room of a Media Center~
   This square-shaped room once seemed to serve as a storage chamber of sorts, 
but almost everything appears to have been ripped up and looted long since. 
Dust has found refuge in the torn up catches upon the rubberized floor, heavy 
objects having left their indented marks when they were dragged southwards. 
Derelict shelving runs most of the length of the fore wall, dented, dusty and 
barren.

A Long Corridor of Doors~
   Composed of heavy, metal squares with a herringbone pattern, the corridor 
has been painted a cream with black flecks. Contrasting, the floor is an steel 
grey, both rubberized and textured to provide a firm step along it. Sliding 
doors lay opposite each other, the hallway continuing to both the port and 
starboard sides. Walking is muffled throughout, though it stirs up the dust of 
many years.

   The cream-panelled hallway meets its end at a prominent door, sliding doors 
lining the lengthy expanse along the fore and aft sides. The rubberized-floor 
is a steel-grey hue, providing secure footing for travel. The corners of the 
hallway have been rounded off, a small feature of safety in the circumstance of 
collision.

bunkbeds, this is one of the few carpeted regions of the ship. Seemingly

was bolted to the floor has been ripped up, leaving catches in the carpet.

a desk that appears to have a computer unit torn out of it. A sliding, clear

benches that have been torn up from the floor, bolted marks indented into the 
floor. Dusty remains of lockers are along the wall itself, the doors of many

smoke that would pour from a functional machine. Even though the chamber in 
its expansive state would fit a moderate horde of people, the heat overwhelming 
the room would keep most closer towards the blast-doors.

The Firebreather's Pit: The Bullet Eaters~
   The metal panels lining the walls have a layer of soot, scrubbed and 
recoated time and again. Dust filters across the rubberized, dark grey floor, 
scuffed from heavy objects and the tread of traffic across it. The interior of 
this large chamber would fit a number of people, even with the mechanical 
monster taking up the majority of the room. A small #2metal plate#0 is bolted

Firebreather Pit: The Cloth Turners~
   Large enough to accomodate a flurry of activity that likely would overwhelm 
the metal-slats of this chamber, the large crocodilian Firebreather still 
dominates the majority of the room. The dark grey flooring extends from wall 
to wall, scrapes and scuffs cutting into, but not through, the rubberized 
matting. Heavy commercial grating covers the starboard side of the ceiling, 
set to filter out smoke into panelled ventilation systems. A small #2metal

black smoke hovering along the ceiling of this large chambered room. A heavy 
commercial grating encases the majority of the ceiling on the port side, 
sending blackened layers into the ventilation system. Large enough to allow 
for a number of people, the piling and handling of plastic and the usage of 
caustic chemicals would keep most closer to the door. A small #2metal plate#0

The Firebreather's Pit: The Metal Eaters~
   The textured white walls have been overrun by a layer of blackened smoke, 
spewing forth from the large Firebreathing machine overwhelming the spacious 
area. The majority of the workers bear the natural burly size this profession 
requires, hefting up massive metal objects and feeding them into the maw of the 
machine. The bustling bodies of people waiting their turn, conversing and 
milling men only add to the oppressive heat which creates an almost 
claustrophobic atmosphere. A small #2metal plate#0 is bolted into the wall 
near the eastern doorway.

A Cramped Airlock~
   This cramped airlock has very little standing room save for the very middle 
of the passage, the rest of the area taken up by heavy benches. Several heavy 
looking lockers have been welded onto the walls as well, though they don't 
appear to have any doors on them. Within each are several hooks and clasps, 
clearly designed to hold some piece of specialized equipment. To starboard is 
a heavy security door, several warnings etched prominently on the surface. A 
manual release is centered on the door, while above it is stenciled, #6"SBS 
ATLAS ACCESS."#0 To port is a similar door, #6"EXTERIOR ACCESS"#0 stenciled on 
the door.

A Transparent Passage~
   The only opaque surface of this airlock is the floor, made up of a rigid 
polyprop material. All around, clear polyprop strains against the vacuume of 
space, serving as a thin barrier between those within and the abyss beyond. To 
starboard is a heavy matte metal door, several red warning lights flush against 
it, while the words "AIRLOCK" stenciled onto the surface, the paint faded. To 
port is what appears to be an almost temporary hatchway, made from a clear 
polyprop with several heavy-duty handels set against it, warnings stenciled 
across the surface. Outside the clear polyprop to starboard, the massive 
structure of the SBS Atlas stretches downward, each deck of the control section 
outlined against the field of stars beyond. To port, a landing stair stretches 
downward into the red clay of the world below. Even from here, one can see the 
colors of sky and the bright red of Mars below.

A Small Empty Shop~
   Bereft of the wares that would solidify the purpose of this space, this 
small shop rests under a thin layer of powder-fine dust. The rubberized floor 
is further dulled by this accumulation and the white metal-bound walls are 
streaked and dulled. Shelves line the walls not overtaken by the doorway, 
although they remain bare. In the center of the room is a narrow glass-lined 
counter that serves a dual purpose. Items can be stored within the display 
attractively, though none seem to be present at the moment, and the back of the 
counter allows for some minor storage, with a few inset nooks present.

A Small Abandoned Shop~
   The rubberized floor lining everything beneath foot is dulled by the 
accumulation of dust that signals several years of abandonment. White

center of the room is a narrow glass-lined counter that serves a dual purpose.

A Dusty Abandoned Shop~
   Shelves line every wall of this shop, though the only thing seeming to be on 
sale is the same thick layer of dust that covers everything within. The floor, 
a rubberized surface, bears the bulk of the untouched powdery substance. The 
white walls rimmed with metal are dulled by the grime, streaks bearing no 
fingerprints from visitors. In the center of this space is a long bolted in 
counter, a display showing nothing but dusty jewel-toned fabric where something 
else was once sold. It serves dual purpose as the back side of this counter 
has some cubbies that could be used to hide away items from customers.

A Dusty Old Shop~
   The rubberized flooring serving as a prominent feature throughout the ship 
is continued in here, although caked with dust from years of abandonment. The 
walls are white, rimmed with metal, and likewise streaked with grime. Shelves 
line the northern, eastern, and southern walls. Though many, they seem largely 
bare, as dusty as the floors and as grimy as the walls. In the center of the 
room, lengthwise, a large plexiglass counter rests here. It serves dual 
purpose, as a fine enough display case though empty, and as a supply of extra 
storage. Numerous cubbies are built into the 'desk', serving to hold all 
manner of things but indeed currently holding nothing.

An Abandoned Guard Station (Block B)~
   The flat dark grey paint only adds to the bleak surroundings apparent even 
in this old guard station. The fore wall may have once housed a set of 
electronic consoles, but all that remains is a few twisted shards of metal 
where it once laid. Rubberized flooring beneath the feet is almost black in 
color, lightened by the ages of dust that have accumulated here. The 
furnishings have been ripped out, leaving a lackluster and empty space. 
   The starboard door is labeled #6"Senior Corrections Officer"#0, although the 
plaque is hanging at a loose angle from rusty bolts.

A Dusty Prison Office (Block B)~
   Perhaps sizeable enough for a single person, the drab grey walls of this old 
office do nothing to produce the illusion of extra space. A grimy tiled-off 
section stands on the fore side, present with a small sink, toilet and stand-up 
shower space and parititioned only by the tattered shreds of a plastic curtain. 
Painted over the starboard wall is the logo of a golden-man holding up a grey 
globe. Time has worn the enamel from its once proud mural state, leaving 
something much more faded. The floor is rubberized and textured for grip, 
almost black in color if it weren't for the dust that litters the area.

An Abandoned Guard Station (Block A)~
   The flat dark grey paint only adds to the bleak surroundings apparent even 
in this old guard station. The fore wall may have once housed a set of 
electronic consoles, but all that remains is a few twisted shards of metal 
where it once laid. Rubberized flooring beneath the feet is almost black in 
color, lightened by the ages of dust that have accumulated here. The 
furnishings have been ripped out, leaving a lackluster and empty space.  

   The port door is labeled "#6Senior Corrections Officer#0", although the 
plaque is hanging at a loose angle from rusty bolts.

A Dusty Prison Office (Block A)~
   Perhaps sizeable enough for a single person, the drab grey walls of this old 
office do nothing to produce the illusion of extra space. A grimy tiled-off 
section stands on the fore side, present with a small sink, toilet and stand-up 
shower space and partitioned only by the tattered shreds of a plastic curtain. 
Painted over the starboard wall is the logo of a golden-man holding up a grey 
globe. Time has worn the enamel from its once proud mural state, leaving 
something much more faded. The floor is rubberized and textured for grip, 
almost black in color if it weren't for the dust that litters the area. There 
is a gaping hole here emptying out into space from wide hull breach.

A Section of a Blocked Off Ventilation System~
   Although quite decent in size, this ventilation system does not allow for 
much room to move around in. It would likely be impossible for anyone taller 
than five feet in height to stand up straight. Made of thick slats of chrion, 
it probably once was able to withstand a fair amount of weight within it and 
the scuffs and dings inside hint that they were occasionally travelled in the 
past. However, time has worn some of the siding and lingering on top of some 
of the weaker areas may be dangerous.

A Dusty Section of the Old Ventilation System~
   Slats of chrion encases this sizeable ventilation system, though no one over 
five feet tall could stand up. It doesn't appear to have been used in some 
time, thick amounts of dust clogging up corners and the ground. Although dings 
and warped metal hint to the fact others may have travelled here in the past, 
many spots along the tunnel don't look as if they will support a large amount 
of weight. The nearby hum of the current ventilation system gives you the 
clear idea that this archaic tunneled structure hasn't been used for some time.

and a few unknown spills have stained the area here and there, leading to a 
vaguely unsanitary feel. Little decoration marks the white squares of the 
walls, the thick metal pocked with occasional scuffs and scratches. Marks are 
left where shelves have been torn down, laying in a mess of polyplastic debris 
upon the floor. A #2biometric handscanner#0 has been installed beside the

An Auditorium turned Market~
   This was once a large, open auditorium. Semicircular rows of seats must 
have existed here, suggested by the odd bit of metal from a floor-mounted 
chair, but most of this has been pilfered to make way for a market. Makeshift 
stalls, selling floors and other marketplace features now occupy most of the 
space in the back, and a noisy auction takes place on a raised podium at the 
front of the auditorium. The walls retain their uniform herringbone pattern, 
the only thing about this area that seems consistent.

The Skyfire Lounge~
   Shaped into an immense circle, the perimeter of this lounge is only broken 
by the sliding blast-doors and recesses which allow for extra seating. The 
high ceiling arches into a dome, supported by sturdy chrion beams that connect 
in the center with the emblem of a golden man holding up a globe. Metal 
panelled walls look to have once been painted into a fusion of golden tones 
like an encompassing horizon at dawn, but time has faded the colors to a dull 
finish. Assorted tables and booths are placed around the room, surrounding the 
bar at the very center. A wide set of three steps lead westwards into another 
area. 
   Noticeably in the aft corner, the cream-colored floor has slid away to 
reveal a set of steel black stairs downward.

An Auditorium turned Market~
   Here, in the other end of the auditorium, every bit of space has been 
devoted to now vacant merchant's stalls, selling floors, and vendor stands. 
The quiet of the auction is at most times deafening, echoing due to the 
hollowed state of it. The rubberized floor is dirty and sticky, and the 
herringbone-patterned walls come to a featureless halt at the starboard end.

The Golden Crew Den~
   Golden-hued enamel covers the walls of this back lounge, met halfway with a 
panelled covering of faux-wood. The stale aroma of herbal smoke lingers here, 
settling over the square shaped chamber. Assorted tables and booths litter the 
establishment, arranged near several monitors lining the walls. The carpet 
underfoot is a dusky grey color, the once soft threads stained and matted 
together from spills, traffic and dust. Rows of recessed rectangular lights 
are flush with the molding around the ceiling, settling over the area with a 
dim, yellowish glow. An unobtrusive storage door is set near the back with a 
handscanner, serving as a portal for employees.

A Dome-Shaped Medical Lounge~
   This lounge was constructed into a circular shape, the only access being a a 
thin staircase leading to the level below. Although it looks as though there 
was once a door that barred the staircase, the hinges have been all but ripped 
off. The finely textured walls and the dome-shaped ceiling have been painted 
in a pale blue hue. Like most of the medical facility, the floor is 
rubberised, dark grey. Other than the seating lining the room, the lounge is 
bare of furniture. 
   The fore wall features a #3sliding door#0 set into the pale blue interior.

An Old Electrical Supply Closet (Block A)~
   Dank and musty, this old storage closet seems to have a decent amount of 
space for supplies. Even though it has been stripped of anything useful, a few 
useless wires serve as a reminder of what it was once used for. Plastic hooks 
with the ends rounded off for safety purposes hang along the wall, many of them 
bent into useless angles. The white metal walls bear the occasional scuffs and 
scratches, standing otherwise unadorned by any sort of decoration. A

down against the port side, stripped of any lab equipment or supplies. Little 
decoration marks the moderate-sized room, grime and dust ample upon the corners

A Grimy, Aged Laboratory Lounge~
   This grimy lounge was constructed in a circular shape, the walls papered 
with faded scrolled print and the green-hued ceiling decidedly domed. Time has 
faded much of the color of both the print and the paint, causing flaking and 
peeling respectively. The rubberized floor has a tacky surface crafted of 
layers of mold that has grown sticky with age, simply adding to the dark grey 
color and making it appear almost black. Stripped wiring and broken plastic 
embedded in the wall are the only remnants of the mostly barren chamber. The 
only access to this space would be the #3sliding door#0 and thin staircase 
leading to the level below.

A Dirty, Circular Electronics Lounge~
   With a lofty domed ceiling and decidedly circular shape to the room, it 
remains largely cut off due to the one entrance guarded by a #3sliding door#0. 
Beyond rests a thin staircase leading downward. Though perhaps once 
beautifully decorated in simplicity, the egg-shell paint on both the walls and 
the ceiling have flaked and peeled into disrepair. Stripped wiring and broken 
plastic embedded in the wall are the only remnants of the mostly barren 
chamber. The floor is a thick tacky rubber, layered with years and years of 
grime and dirt and thusly more black than the normal dark grey.

An Old Grimy Shop~
   This space seems to have been left for a lengthy period of time, much grime 
and dust lingering everywhere. The floor, continuing from the west, is a 
rubberized surface in plain dark gray, showing every single speck out of place. 
The white walls are rimmed with metal and dulled by the grime, streaks bearing 
no fingerprints from visitors. A long bolted counter is in the center of this 
space, a display showing nothing but old cloth where something else was once 
sold. It serves dual purpose as the back side of the counter has some cubbies 
that could be used to hide away items from customers. Shelves line every wall 
sporadically.

walls have been covered with egg-shell white paint, striped and split with a 
single stripe of dull grey. The floors are the same rubberized dark grey found 
almost everywhere, though kept free from the dust that seems to hang in the 
air. A few subtle paintings displaying a glorious city, marked below with the 
words 'New Phoenix' break the monotony of the room. You may #6CASH OUT#0 to

A Stuffy Medical Storage Room (Medbay Storage)~
   Picked over and trashed, this old storage closet still has a fair amount of 
space for supplies. The bare rubberized floors are littered thickly with dust 
and a few unknown spills have stained the area here and there, leading to a 
vaguely unsanitary feel. Little decoration marks the white squares of the 
walls, the thick metal pocked with occasional scuffs and scratches. Marks are 
left where shelves have been torn down, laying in a mess of polyplastic debris 
upon the floor. A #2biometric handscanner#0 has been installed beside the 
door, providing access to authorized personnel.

A Small, Clear Polyprop Airlock~
   Serving as no more than a brief catch point between the nearly hidden 
doorway westward and the eastern polyprop sliding door, this small room is 
rectangular in shape. It appears to be wider than it is long. The air is 
stale, caught between the two sealed doors. The view is alarming, as both the 
ceiling, floor, and walls are crafted of thick polyprop plastic, leaving bare 
space in every single direction.

A Centralized Control Room~
   Myriad consoles alight with static-marked screens line the walls in this 
expansive control room. The floor is textured rubber, meant to offer traction, 
and the walls are metallic, coated with bland white paint. Each of the 
consoles is connected to a row of curving benches, serving as seating. The air 
smells stale, perhaps because of the constantly circulating and filtered puffs 
of recycled air.

A Bunkroom and Miniature Messhall~
   Bland white paint has been scratched in some areas, carved away from the 
herringbone textured metal panels underneath. The rubberized flooring seems to 
have been left untouched, though is covered with a layer of dust impacted with 
the remains of footprints. Stale air contains a hint of putrid decay, though 
it's difficult to determine the source. Scratched into the paint on one wall, 
nearby some tallies, are the words #1"ALWAYS WATCHING. NEVER LIVING."#0

Before Several Escape Pods~
   This semi-circular room is smooth and sleek, painted a bland white over 
metallic structure. A foot apart of the half-circle is marked by a clear 
polyprop window, once serving as a door to a now-ejected pod. Settled over 
each of the now-windows are square lights, all of them red. The floor is 
textured rubber, offering ample traction. A button rests beside each of the 
pod openings, marked with the words #6"Force Eject"#0.

A Private Virtual Reality Center~
   Light seems to be absorbed by the gun-black metal of this room, the circular 
expanse almost featureless and lending a claustrophobic aspect to the interior. 
The upper tier, set around an ascending platform, is lined with all manner of 
circuitry and machinery behind a smoky plexiglass casing. The lower tier is 
around a featureless pillar, standing sentinel from a mist that drifts around 
the floor. A certain stench of decay permeates this area, with greasy pools 
decorating the floor around the coffin-shaped pods. Small pieces of what might 
have once been human bodies can also be seen, including teeth and clumps of 
oozing, dark grey-black matter.
