The Northern Gatehouse~
   Solid concrete walls rises to the east and west, providing the anchors for 
the paired gates that face each other both to the north and south. A rickety, 
sheet-metal staircase is set into the southern concrete wall, leading upwards 
to a trapdoor above. The gates stand at least twelve feet high to the south, 
made from crudely-wrought steel. The gates rise as tall as ten feet high, 
barring both north and south, made out reinforced high quality iron alloy. 
   You realize you must #6CALL GATEGUARD#0 to be let out.

The Western Gatehouse~
   The massive gates that make up the east and western walls of 
this gatehouse are at least twelve feet high, made from 
crudely-wrought steel. Thick hinges connect them to concrete 
walls, and large steel bars sit on either side of the eastern 
gate - to be used to both lock and brace the gate against any 
intruder. A rickety, sheet-metal staircase is set into the 
southern concrete wall, leading upwards to a trapdoor above. 
Traffic here is fairly thin, with those that pass mostly keeping 
to themselves. You can pass through the gates with #6CALL

A Spacious, Brown-Carpeted Office~
   This room is quite spacious with weathered, wooden shelves 
that loom in the far corner of the wall filled with a few 
knick-knacks and a creaky ceiling fan hanging from the center of 
the room. The paint on the walls are faded and chipped, much 
like the rest of the building but the floor is covered in a 
shaggy, dark-brown carpet, its age obvious due to the missing 
patches of fabric here and there. The carpet changes to 
scratched wooden flooring in the corner near the shelves where a 
large desk filled with many drawers and cabinets stands.

East and West past the Matured Buildings of Main Street~
   Most of the well-made storefronts and buildings of Grungetown 
run along the length of Main Street, constructed of concrete and 
metal framing that is obviously worn, but often repaired. A 
constant flow of heavy traffic crowds the street here, most 
people traveling to or from the open markets to the north-west, 
or the large intersection to the west that marks the centre of 
town. The shouts of vendors and the murmuring of voices drifts 
in from the markets and, combined with the sound of the crowd, 
make this street quite noisy.

one from the sun during the day. A bright sign runs just above

The Intersection of Junkyard Row and Wilmington Way ~
   Junkyard Row meets Wilmington Way in this four-way 
intersection, the street corners often busy with people milling 
about. There is a stark contrast, however, between the buildings 
that line the street. To the north, the sidewalks are lined with 
a few stores or commercial buildings, some abandoned. However, 
to the south, what was once Wilmington Park has now been overrun 
by a sea of residential shanties built just inside the fencing of 
the park. A large arch spans the width of Junkyard Row to the 
south just at the entrance of the Park, a relic of the past.

Junkyard Row, South of Wilmington Way ~
   The wide, paved road of Junkyard Row continues south here, 
away from Wilmington Way, which is just visible to the north 
beneath the entry arch to the slums. What was once a park has 
been overrun by a pile of shanties, each one barely taller than 
one's head and built by makeshift hands of plastic and metal 
sheeting. The deeper into the park one travels the worse in 
condition the road becomes, large cracks visible in the asphalt 
with various potholes repaired shoddily with piles of trash that 
have been compacted and stuffed inside the depressions. There 
are quite a number of people that pass this way, many with 
visible physical deformities, and the street is rarely deserted.

Junkyard Row Between Side Streets~
   Two narrow side-streets intersect the main road of Junkyard 
Row here, heading east and west. The path underfoot is packed 
down dirt and gravel, the original road all but weathered away, 
though the sidewalks to either side are riddled with fractures 
and cracks. Heavy traffic heads through the area in all 
directions: north to where the wide intersection of Main Street 
and Junkyard Row can be seen in the distance, south, towards 
Crater Lake, and finally east and west, to the various shanty 
shops that line its streets.

Junkyard Row, North of Wilmington Way~
   Junkyard Row runs north, stretching on towards the gate of the 
Perimeter far off in the distance and south to where Crater Lake 
lies. However, directly south is the large intersection of where 
this street cuts right through Wilmington Way, perpendicular to 
the road that runs east-to-west. Heavy traffic flows here at all 
times as it filters out into the center of the city, and has 
pound the road to nothing but gravel and dust.

the Perimeter is visible, and the wide, heavily-traveled 
intersection of Main Street and Junkyard Row is much closer to 
the east. Quite a few people pass through this area, filtering 
in from the center of the town to their various destinations and 
keeping this road quite lively, even at night.

East of a Path through Wilmington Park~
   This section of Junkyard Row has all but been worn to dirt. 
All that is left is gravel, dust, and trash, all of that trampled 
underfoot by travelers. Ghetto housing has been erected upon the 
park grounds by makeshift hands, made of sheets of plastic or 
metal, with no effort made to paint them. The homes are so 
closely-packed and of substandard quality that sound travels 
easily here, the sound of domestic fighting or music often heard 
echoing down the street. South, a dock over Crater Lake can be 
seen far in the distance, and a narrow path breaks off west 
through the ramshackle shanties.

West of a Path through Wilmington Park~
   The grayed pavement of Junkyard Row frays at the edges, large 
chunks uprooted and peeling away from the dirt beneath. Trash 
has been pounded into the dirt by passing feet, filling in many 
of the potholes in the ground. Lining both sides of the street 
is a solid row of shanties, each one little taller than 
head-height. The walls are made out of whatever materials seemed 
to be available at the time, tacked together by whatever means 
necessary. The street continues north and south but a small path 
branches east through the ghetto homes.

End of Junkyard Row at the Edge of Crater Lake~
   The slum housing begins to thin along the pothole-covered road 
while the amount of travellers increases. It is here that 
Junkyard Row approaches the docks visible to the south at the 
edge of Crater Lake. Numerous weeds and small flora have taken 
root here, growing between the cracks that scar the weathered 
pavement, and some vines have begun to creep and attach to some 
of the tiny shanties that line the rim of the lake. Junkyard Row 
heads north here towards the center of the city and a cleared 
path just outside the rim of the lake heads west.

East and West on Main Street~
   This stretch of Main Street is wide, with crumbling edges 
where the pavement has weathered to almost nothing, leaving 
behind gravel and dirt. Darker patches of asphalt in the center 
of the road reveal attempts to repair the worst of the damage, 
but no effort has been made to clean up the trash that litters 
the sidewalks. The few buildings lining the road have fallen 
into disrepair, with pocked walls, plastic-boarded windows, and 
battered doors. Several bits graffiti decorate the sidewalks and 
walls, each one in what looks like a different style. People 
pass through the area frequently, most continuing on their way 
east or west.

South of a Tool Shop~
   Jagged cracks run through much of the asphalt along this 
stretch of Main Street. Attempts have obviously been made to 
repair the cracks, resulting in a maze-like pattern of darker, 
newer asphalt beneath the scattered trash. Stores stand to 
either side of the street, the southern one apparently abandoned, 
with a large gunshot through its window. The store to the north 
is quite small, though it seems to be in business, with a steady, 
if meagre, stream of customers. A few people loiter in this 
area, through most continue on along the road to the east or 
west.

Main Street, East of Umbra Road~
   The wide road of Main Street runs east and west through the 
center of Grungetown. Its pavement is weathered and cracked, 
though it appears to have been repeatedly repaired. While the 
buildings that stand to either side of the road are of much 
higher quality than most buildings in town, they don't seem to 
attract many customers; few people linger in this area, most 
heading west to the gate seen far in the distance, or east toward 
the intersection of Main Street and Junkyard Row.

street of Umbra Road which cuts a path north and south through 
the ramshackle buildings. While little traffic passes through

this ill-maintained stretch of road. Most of the buildings

scavenged material, their dirty windows displaying shabby wares. 
Buzzard Boulevard is visible to the west, from which direction

The Intersection of Main Street and Buzzard Boulevard~
   Buzzard Boulevard and Main Street intersect in a wide, 
well-worn crossroad, though which heavy pedestrian traffic flows 
without much interruption, despite the total lack of any system 
to control it. Dilapidated buildings line the intersection, some 
of them shoddily repaired, others crumbling husks. Although the 
concrete underfoot is riddled with fractures and cracks, the path 
is surprisingly level.

Before the West Gate~
   The highly fortified gate rising to the west serves as the 
main entrance into Grungetown from the moonscape outside the 
Perimeter. A throng of people passes through the area, and the 
air is alive with chatter from the travelers and faint calls from 
the Open Markets far to the northeast. Old concrete buildings 
line the street across from the Perimeter. Most are weathered 
and crumbling, but a few shows signs of recent repair, with holes 
patched by scrap metal and thick-gauge plastic. The buildings 
farther to the south along West Street appear increasingly 
dilapidated.

   The high walls of the Perimeter encase all of Grungetown and 
serving as defense against the foreign moonscape or any creatures 
that wander outside. The wall itself is made of the same, thick 
metal as the gate, reinforced in weakening spots by more metal 
plates and seems to be the only edifice in the town that has been 
continually repaired. It is structurally-sound with a walkway 
visible running along the top of the wall while its length has

   A heavily fortified gate rises up to the west formed of thick, 
metal plating that has rusted in a few spots, dented in others. 
It is double-reinforced by a thick, metal grating that lines the

moonscape. The gate itself is rectangular in shape and a walkway 
runs right across it, visible up above.

North and South on Junkyard Row~
   Large chunks of concrete run along the side of Junkyard Row, 
pushed to the edges out of the way of the heavy traffic that 
constantly flows here. The street continues down a path of 
abandoned buildings, though the building to the west is occupied 
by a shop, its sign crudely hanging above the door. Other, 
smaller structures were even once built atop of some of the 
toppled foundations - shanties constructed of salvaged materials 
from the now skeletal remains.

Junkyard Row, South of Main Street~
   Buildings thicken here in quantity as Junkyard Row heads 
further south towards the center of the city, thinning in number 
as it heads north towards the north gate of the Perimeter. The 
buildings themselves have served as stores, homes, or anything 
other imaginable, built upon the ruins of other, old buildings 
over and over again that still have pieces of their foundation 
visible. The street has a heavy flow of traffic at all times 
during the day and it is rarely quiet here, even the sound of the 
city almost drowned out by the constant throng of people.

The Intersection of Junkyard Row and Main Street~
   Junkyard Row crosses Main Street at this busy intersection. 
Large chunks of concrete have been pushed to the side of the 
road, out of the way of the heavy traffic. Ruined buildings are 
visible along Main Street to the west, and while most of the 
storefronts lining Junkyard Row seem cramped and useless, at 
least many of them are still standing. Junkyard Row continues 
north, toward the Perimeter gate visible far in the distance, and 
south, while Main Street heads east and west as far as the eye 
can see.

Junkyard Row Between Main Street and the Market~
   A few, forsaken shops line the road, their windows and doors 
boarded up though one or two are still in use like peddler stands 
that sell a variety of little trinkets, trying to cater to the 
heavy mass of people that constantly flow through the area 
heading both north and south. Garbage and scraps of all kinds, 
electronic or otherwise, have been dragged through the area, more 
often than not just thrown to the side of the street. South 
leads to a small intersection where the street continues, 
weathered and grayed. 
   To the west stands a warehouse, and massive doors leading 
inwards. Upon the door is a painting of two men, one red and one 
blue, locked in brutal battle. To the north stands an iron gate, 
and you realize you must #6CALL GATEGUARD#0 to proceed any

Before the North Gate~
   A break in the pitted metal sheeting of the Perimeter opens a 
gap here, and scarred steel beams form the wide arch of the north 
gate. People throng through the converging streets, mostly 
heading north to the road beyond the gate or south to points 
deeper in the city. Scraps of rubble and trash are compacted 
underfoot after having been dragged in from outside, though the 
ground is most heavily-littered nearest the gate. Spreading out 
to the east, south, and west are the Open Markets, bustling with 
trade at all hours.

Main Street~
   The wide road of Main Street runs east and west here, cutting 
through the center of Grungetown. Along its length, old, 
concrete buildings have been partially restored and turned into 
filthy shops. Though they seem to be of better quality than many 
of the other buildings in town, most have been abandoned, windows 
and doors boarded up with sheets of plastic or sealed with scraps 
of metal. A steady flow of traffic runs through the area, much 
of it heading west toward the laughter and chatter that echoes 
from a nearby bar.

A Bend North and West on Main Street~
   Along this slightly-curving stretch of road, concrete and 
steel buildings that toppled long ago have been cannibalized for 
the materials needed to erect cramped shops. Sheets of plastic 
shade any customers who wander inside the makeshift stalls to 
haggle over the wares. The street itself is one of the best 
maintained in all of Grungetown, with splotches of dark cement a 
testament to the effort made to repair the worn pavement.

   This short stretch of Main Street runs north and south between 
two bends in the road, winding through dilapidated shops and 
abandoned buildings. The steady flow of traffic compacts trash 
underfoot, and while the road is worn, there have been obvious 
attempts to repair the asphalt. The battered walls of the 
buildings in this area are relatively clean, and streetlights 
line the road in a shoddy attempt at symmetry.

A Bend East and South on Main Street~
   The road turns gently here, as Main Street bears south through 
the center of town and stretches east toward the eastern gate of 
the Perimeter, very far off in the distance. The roof of a 
building to the south has collapsed inside the crumbling walls, 
blocking passage through an open doorway beyond which debris and 
ceiling beams are visible. A store to the north stands beside 
the few other intact buildings, the restored shops significantly 
smaller than the older, larger foundations of their predecessors.

East and West on Main Street~
   Shanties constructed of salvaged materials squat atop the 
unstable remains of collapsed concrete-and-metal buildings. The 
rattle of falling pebbles occasionally sounds, as does the low 
groan of torqued metal buried beneath the rubble. Main Street 
continues east and west here, and a scattering of people use the 
road, though most don't linger, instead continuing west toward a 
bend in the road, or in the opposite direction, toward the east 
gate of the Perimeter, visible in the far distance.

   Main Street intersects Anarchy Way immediately to the east, 
and farther in that direction the high wall of the Perimeter 
looms. To the west, Main Street continues toward the center of 
the city. One of Grungetown's more popular clothing stores 
stands to the south, constructed of sun-dried cement with deep 
cracks in its forward-facing wall. While a steady flow of 
traffic continues past, many people enter or exit the clothing 
shop.

The Intersection of Main Street and Revolutionary Way~
   Revolutionary Way intersects Main Street here, cutting a path 
north and south through blocks of deteriorating buildings. A few 
people mill about on the street-corners, though most continue 
west toward the center of the town, or head north or south on 
Anarchy Way. Very few people continue east toward where the 
rising gate of the Perimeter looms over the city. All the shops 
on this street-corner are abandoned save the one to the 
southwest, which seems quite popular.

East of the Intersection between Main and Revolutionary~
   Large chunks of concrete have been uprooted from the street 
and pushed to the sidewalks, serving as cautions against the 
random showers of detritus that fall from the crumbling buildings 
lining the street. The buildings themselves apparently collapsed 
long ago, and other, smaller structures were built on atop the 
rubble, only to collapse in turn. A faded spray of intricate 
graffiti coveres one of the largest concrete chunks, though the 
others appear untouched. Only few people travel this stretch of 
road, though to the west, where a large intersection lies, more 
are visible.

   Main Street runs east and west here, cutting a path through 
the center of Grungetown. The concrete-and-metal buildings that 
once lined the street collapsed into rubble long ago, and other, 
smaller structures were built atop the wreckage - shanties 
constructed of salvaged materials from the now-skeletal remains. 
The groan of battered foundations settling into the ground can 
occasionally be heard, as can the rattle of pebbles falling from 
low roofs. 
   The Perimeter looms to the east, and south is completely 
impassable - nothing but the ruined husks of buildings can be 
seen, layered right up against each other.

Approaching the East Gate~
   Little traffic passes through this section of Main Street, 
which is lined by buildings in various states of collapse. Some 
merely look treacherous and deserted, with crumbling corners and 
sunken roofs, but others are piles of hazardous rubble, rife with 
sharp edges and protruding beams. Large chunks of cement, 
uprooted from the ground, impede travel over the trash-encrusted 
ground, and random showers of rock and cement fall from above. 
   The gate of Perimeter looms to the east.

Before the East Gate~
   The highly-fortified gate that rises to the east serves as an 
entrance into Grungetown from the moonscape past the walls of the 
Perimeter. Only a few pass through the thick, battered doors, 
which obviously aren't used as much as the other gates of the 
town, and are almost always closed. The Perimeter stops a short 
length beyond the rim of the crater to the south, which extends 
into the water of the lake to prevent passage. 
   Main Street continues west into the distance, while East 
Street branches to the north, running parallel to the looming 
wall.

   Crater Lake, albeit somewhat small, spans a long way to the

movement may catch one's eye. The surface is an icy slush of 
water that has risen to the surface though it becomes a solid,

~
E
gate~
   A heavily fortified gate rises up to the east formed of thick, 
metal plating that has rusted in a few spots, dented in others. 
It is double-reinforced by a thick, metal grating that lines the 
inside of the gate, providing extra defense against the foreign 
moonscape. The gate itself is rectangular in shape and a walkway 
runs right across it, visible up above.

   The high walls of the Perimeter encase all of Grungetown and 
serving as defense against the foreign moonscape or any creatures 
that wander outside. The wall itself is made of the same, thick 
metal as the gate, reinforced in weakening spots by more metal 
plates and seems to be the only edifice in the town that has been 
continually repaired. It is structurally-sound with a walkway 
visible running along the top of the wall while its length has 
been covered with various graffiti marks.

North Street, West of the Open Market~
   A wide, cement warehouse stands to the south, spanning the 
entire length of this stretch of road. Quite a few people pass 
through its sturdy, battered doors, and others head east toward 
the north gate that allows access into the junkyard. The stench 
of refuse is fainter here, and splotches of black cement 
underfoot seem to indicate a fairly recent attempt to hide damage 
to the road, contrasting sharply with the rest of the roads 
throughout Grungetown.

a bend where the Perimeter begins to curve southward. A cluster 
of buildings stands to the south, many of them with crumbling 
concrete walls or collapsed plastic roofs, others not much more 
than heaps of rubble. A few buildings, however, have had their 
windows and doors covered with crude barriers, blocking access.

shape, with only a few cracks and potholes, and most of the 
asphalt remaining. The buildings that line the street are little 
more than shanties, with crumbling concrete walls patched by 
scrap metal or junk plastic, or simply left to deteriorate 
further. Though there is little traffic here, the sound of

side of the street is lined by the burnt husks of shanties and 
the eastern side by the ruins of shops. A hush hangs over the 
area, broken by an occasional squeak or scurrying that sounds 
from within the rubble.

Drive follows its length past a row of crumbling structures to 
the south; metallic husks of houses and fire-ravaged concrete 
walls stand near piles of misshapen rubble. A faint scratching

ravaged by fire, line the street, their plastic shells melted 
into grotesque humps and their disfigured metal walls smudged 
with ash. While there is little traffic here, the faint sound of 
vendors shouting prices occasionally echoes over the rooftops.

Buzzard Boulevard Meets the Northern Perimeter~
   Buzzard Boulevard and Darkness Drive intersect here, the 
former heading south toward Main Street, and eventually Crater 
Lake, and the latter winding north and west. The looming 
Perimeter rises overhead, casting parts of this intersection into 
near-permanent shadow. The road is a mixture of crumbling 
concrete and hard-packed dirt, with the irregular flow of 
pedestrians trampling a few dusty weeds underfoot.

Main Street, West of Buzzard Boulevard ~
   Main Street cuts a path through the near-constant shade of the 
looming Perimeter, intersecting Buzzard Boulevard to the east and 
West Street in the opposite direction. This stretch of Main is 
wide and fairly uncluttered, allowing travelers to circumvent the 
marketplace just south of here with relative ease. Ramshackle 
buildings border the road, some as high as four and five stories, 
their concrete walls stained, and washing lines draped between 
windows. The northwest corner of Grungetown lies to the west, 
not too far from the West Gate.

Main Street Near the Northwest Corner~
   Main Street runs between the high Perimeter to the north and a 
row of dilapidated, four-story buildings to the south. Patches 
of the pavement are worn through to dirt and gravel, as this 
stretch of road is heavily-trafficked by the various scavengers, 
hunters and warriors who make their trade beyond the West Gate, 
then travel eastward toward the Open Market. To the immediate 
west, Main Street intersects West Street, and to the east it 
meets Buzzard Boulevard.

East of the Perimeter on Buzzard Boulevard~
   The stretch of the Perimeter that looms to the west seems to 
have undergone extensive makeshift repairs, with wide sections of 
riveted metal bolted to the concrete superstructure. Among the 
dilapidated buildings along the eastern edge of the street are a 
few with securely-boarded windows, and a few that are simply 
burned-out husks. The road is a mixture of crumbling concrete 
and hard-packed dirt. 
   To the north, Buzzard Boulevard meets Darkness Drive, which 
turns east along the northern Perimeter.

   The flow of traffic is light here, especially when compared to 
the intersection of Main Street and Buzzard Boulevard to the

eastwards, their stained walls tagged with mostly-faded graffiti. 
Trash litters the crumbling asphalt, collecting in corners and 
clogging the larger potholes. To the west, the stark, looming 
Perimeter protects Grungetown from all threats. Further north, 
Buzzard Boulevard meets Darkness Drive.

DELETED~
   Stretching all the way to the southern Perimeter wall, West 
Street continues down a long-abandoned cluster of buildings 
blocking any travel eastwards. Most of the buildings have 
toppled, or look near it, and those that are not have been 
heavily boarded over. Rising up to the west is the outer defense 
against threats to Grungetown, the Perimeter wall. The 
relatively close proximity of both the wall and the buildings 
keep the street in shade for most of the day, and combined with 
the constant flow of traffic coming in from the West gate 
situated just north, little grows here.

Umbra Road, South of Darkness Drive~
   Stretching north and south, this block of Umbra Road is lined 
on both sides by dilapidated houses. These ruined homes, little 
more than shanties, are all uninhabitable now, their ashy, metal 
shells ravaged by fire. Large chunks of asphalt are missing from 
the road, making the ground uneven, and a thick layer of trash is 
compacted underfoot. Traffic trickles through his area, though 
only a few people linger.

Umbra Road, Outside a Vulture-Marked Complex~
   Most of the buildings along this stretch of road have been 
ravaged by fire and time, with charred walls, collapsed roofs, 
and crumbling foundations. However, a large complex with the 
Vultures' symbol - a sharp beak with blood dripping from it, 
standing to the west, seems to have been repaired. The pitted 
concrete walls stand firm and the roof, while sagging slightly, 
appears sound. The murmur of voices can be heard from within, 
echoing onto the street. 
   The road runs north toward the Perimeter and south, past an 
intersection, deeper into the city. A few pedestrians wander 
through the area, most pausing to enter the apartments.

their windows cracked or missing, and their walls pocked from

North and South on the Perimeter Near the West Gate~
   Jagged mounds of concrete and rusted metal, the ruins of 
toppled buildings, line the street across from the high Perimeter 
that looms to the west. Cramped shanties dot the wreckage, 
filthy and dark, constructed of material cannibalized from the 
skeletal remains of the fallen buildings. Even the shanties 
appear to be abandoned, though a faint scratching can 
occasionally be heard from the ruins. Large chunks of concrete 
line the sidewalk, having once served to warn travelers of 
concrete falling from the crumbling rooftops. To the north, West 
Street meets West Gate, and to the south it runs toward Crater 
Lake.

   Caught between the looming wall of the Perimeter to the west 
and an abandoned warehouse to the east, this area is gloomy even 
during most sunlight hours. A faded mural, the subject of which 
is no longer discernible, covers a large swathe of the warehouse 
wall. Very little traffic passes this way, and the road 
underfoot is in relatively good repair. Although this stretch of 
West Street is quiet, the pumping sound of music can sometimes 
heard echoing in from the east. The street continues north and 
south, eventually ending at the high wall of the Perimeter.

of trash cluster around a low mound of rubble that rises in the

traffic passes this way, and the road is in better shape than 
most of Grungetown's streets. Although weathered and grayed, the 
asphalt has no chunks missing, and only a few cracks scar the 
surface. A faint scratching can sometimes be heard from a pile 
of rocks and concrete slabs heaped at the foot of a half-fallen 
shop. West Street turns to the immediate south, where it reaches 
the southwestern corner of the Perimeter.

gunfire. Dark, gaping, windowless windows stare at the street 
like the eye sockets in a skull. The Perimeter casts a perpetual 
shadow in this area, adding a foreboding gloom to the pervasive 
hush. The street heads east toward a large intersection in the 
distance, and north for a long stretch.

hollow shells with cracked walls, though some evidence of 
makeshift repairs is visible on a few. This area is shadowed 
during most sunlight hours which combines with the sporadic 
traffic to create a dark and foreboding atmosphere.

travel to the west, along the inside of the looming wall, while 
Buzzard Boulevard continues south toward Crater Lake. The 
tattered concrete-and-steel shells of buildings line this 
ill-maintained stretch of road. A few dismal weeds struggle to

Along Buzzard Boulevard, North of the Perimeter Wall~
   This stretch of Buzzard Boulevard is marred by potholes, most 
of them filled with compacted trash in a makeshift attempt at 
repair. The ruins of derelict buildings line the sidewalks, and 
the few intact structures have cracked walls, sagging roofs, and 
boarded windows and doors. The street, though lit by rusted 
streetlights, is fairly dim, as the high wall of the western 
Perimeter blocks much of the sunlight. Pedestrians are rarely 
seen on this street, though the quiet is occasionally broken by 
the rat-a-tat-tat of gunfire in the distance.

cannibalized from the now-skeletal remains. Rubble is scattered 
across the street, catching in potholes and along the crumbling 
foundations. The bleak street of Buzzard Boulevard continues 
north and south, although a few side streets branch to the east 
and west, little more than dark alleys. Very few people pass 
along this stretch of road, leaving the street silent.

The Intersection of Buzzard Boulevard and Wilmington Way~
   Buzzard Boulevard forms a three-way intersection with 
Wilmington Way among the partially-rebuilt ruins of concrete and 
steel buildings. Sheets of plastic cover shattered windows, 
hardened mud reinforces crumbling concrete, and lengths of 
corrugated tin seal the roofs. Despite the repairs, layers of 
graffiti and a peppering of bullet holes are visible. Buzzard 
Boulevard continues north and hugs the wall of the Perimeter far 
to the south, while Wilmington Way branches eastward.

south here, running parallel to the looming wall of the Perimeter 
to the west. Some of the shoddy buildings lining the street are 
apparently occupied, despite the cracked windows and crumbling 
walls, while others have clearly been abandoned, their interiors 
visibly ransacked. Another intersection is visible a ways to the 
north. A few people usually loiter on the street corners, though 
most of the foot-traffic heads westward, toward the faint sound 
of music.

South of Main Street on Buzzard Boulevard~
   This stretch of Buzzard Boulevard branches southward from Main 
Street, with the high walls of the Perimeter visible to the west. 
Deteriorating buildings line the street, some little more than 
ruins, others showing signs of makeshift repairs: walls patched 
with scrap metal, windows covered with plastic. The pavement is 
heavily worn - dusty weeds struggle through widening cracks and 
trash collects in ever-expanding potholes. A steady flow of 
traffic passes through the area, much of it heading toward the 
intersection to the south.

Umbra Road, South of Main Street~
   Umbra Road continues to run north and south, its asphalt 
cracked and weathered in some places and missing entirely in 
others. Most of the buildings lining the street collapsed long 
ago, and those that remain standing are heavily boarded over. 
The intact buildings are squat and hunched, so the western wall 
of the Perimeter is visible in the distance. There is very 
little traffic along this street, most of it passing to the 
north, where Main Street and Umbra Road intersect.

   The street here has been reduced to gravel and, where the 
asphalt is missing entirely, the rocky ground of the moon itself. 
Weather-beaten buildings of cement and metal stand to either side 
of the road, their windows and doors boarded. Many of the boards 
are riddled with gunshots, and a few of the adjoining walls are 
scrawled with graffiti, giving the area a desolate feel. Umbra 
Road intersects Main Street far to the north, and Wilmington Way 
far to the south.

The road is in no better shape, with wide cracks running down its 
length and chunks of asphalt pushed into slightly-upright 
positions. The road continues north and south, though to the 
south, the intersection with Wilmington Way is visible.

   Most of the buildings in this intersection appear to have been 
abandoned long ago, though a few crumbling shops still cling to 
life. Large chunks of asphalt are missing from the road, and a 
handful of dusty, trampled weeds struggle to grow from the rocky 
ground beneath. Wilmington Way continues east and west, while

   Large chunks of asphalt are simply missing from this wide 
road, exposing patches of the rocky ground beneath. The 
buildings to the west are mostly the ruins of shops and homes, 
while to the east a metal fence encloses the cramped, makeshift 
shanties of Wilmington Park. Faded marks adorn a sheet of thick, 
scarred plastic bolted to the fence, the illegible remnants of a 
once-bright mural.

worn, and in one section charred from what was probably a small

tagged with faded graffiti. A few, however, have simply 
collapsed into piles of wreckage. Rubble from the fallen

   Trash lines the sidewalks, and collects around the dilapidated

Many of the buildings are little more than piles of rubble, and 
the doors and windows of the rest are boarded with sheet metal or 
plastic. This wide road has relatively few potholes, though the 
asphalt is almost worn to gravel in spots. Very little traffic 
passes this way, despite the rather well-made building that 
stands to the east, its walls painted red, and its glass windows 
allowing a view within. The road continues southward, where it 
approaches the rim of Crater Lake.

End of the Perimeter Wall at the Edge of the Lake~
   The looming wall of the Perimeter casts a shadow over the 
street and buildings here during most of the daylight hours. It 
comes to a rusty halt at Crater Lake, extending a short distance 
into the slushy, garbage-strewn water of the lake's surface. The 
buildings end just short of the lake, none having been built upon 
the steep, rocky ground of the crater's high rim. A narrow dirt 
path snakes along the edge of the lake, heading east behind a few 
abandoned shops. 
   A concrete building to the west is barred by a reinforced 
door, installed with a biometric scanner.

Wilmington Way, East of Umbra Road~
   Wilmington Way stretches east and west past a cluster of 
long-abandoned buildings with crumbling walls and collapsed 
roofs. The tallest building is a skeletal husk of rusted metal 
beams and decaying concrete columns. The road is mostly gravel 
and dirt, with a few patches of worn asphalt. A handful of 
stunted weeds struggle through cracks in the sidewalk. Most of 
the sparse traffic in the area the heads toward the intersection 
of Umbra Road and Wilmington Way to the west.

now-skeletal remains. Excepting a few patches of worn asphalt, 
the road underfoot is trash and gravel, from which a handful of 
dusty weeds struggles for life. Wilmington Way continues east

carelessly tossed over the fence. The occasional domestic fight 
or soft mutter of conversation can be from the sea of shanties 
inside the park. A warehouse stands to the north amidst the

had once toppled over have been partially erected again, windows 
boarded up with sheets of plastic and roofs re-sealed with bits

narrow path through a sea of shanty homes. The derelict shops of 
the north have been all but abandoned, many of the windows 
boarded up. The homes that make up the residential area to the 
south are not sturdy in make and are comprised mainly of sheet 
metal and other accumulated junk. A few people pass this way 
though those many of those that turn south seem to bear physical 
deformities.

cramped buildings. Broken bits of concrete and all manner of 
trash fill the gaps between twisted chunks of discolored plastic 
and disfigured metal. Almost nothing remains of the asphalt that 
once paved the street, the ground now covered by dirt and gravel. 
Little traffic passes this way; people rarely tarry here, most 
often heading east to a large intersection of roads in the 
distance. Not far to the west is a much smaller intersection 
that meets the Perimeter where it curves north and east.

   East Street runs north and south here, hugging the looming 
metal wall of the Perimeter to the east. Caught between the 
Perimeter and a row of deteriorating buildings, the street is 
cast in shade for most of the day. Faded graffiti adorns the 
crumbling walls, and the windows of the occupied buildings are a 
filmy plastic instead of glass. The odd bit of trash that 
tumbles down the street, combined with the lack of steady 
traffic, gives the area a rather desolate feel. It is usually 
silent here though the occasional ratta-tat-tat of gunshots can 
be heard in the distance.

North Street, West of Revolutionary Way~
   This battered section of street runs parallel to the northern 
wall, hence its name: "North Street." Stained concrete rises high 
above, dwarfing all other structures nearby. Shorter buildings, 
constructed of pitted concrete, worn plastic, and scrap metal, 
line the south side of the street. The smell of decay is less 
pervasive here, as the street opens into the rubble-strewn 
intersection of Anarchy Way.

The Intersection of North Street and Revolutionary Way~
   This intersection of North Street and Revolutionary Way isn't 
quite as cramped as the surrounding blocks. The towering wall of 
the Perimeter is less of a physical presence, though it still 
looms to the north. Debris and trash aren't quite so thick on 
the ground, brushed mostly to the sides of the run-down street, 
and the horrid stench is fainter. People shuffle about quietly, 
heads bowed to avoid eye contact, for the most part minding their 
own business.

Revolutionary Way Between North and Darkness~
   Revolutionary Way continues north and south here, passing by a 
sheet-metal doored building to the west. The grafitti and trash 
are ever-prevailant, even moreso than the people who pass by, no 
matter how large a crowd they might be in. The western door has 
a crude image painted upon it: that of a flak jacket.

Revolutionary Way, South of Lover's Lane~
   Grafitti covers nearly every square inch of this street, sans 
where the Perimeter reaches high above the reach of any human 
hands. It even, in some places, has been tagged upon trash, 
where years of compaction have made it into a solid mass. The 
more prominent symbol in the walls of grafitti is that of a 
crude, encircled letter "A," marking Revolutionary Way as it 
proceeds north-to-south.

Revolutionary Way Turns East into Lover's Lane~
   The looming Perimeter turns here, and thereby causes the 
street running against it to turn as well. Cast perpetually in 
shade, it would be hard to tell which roads these two were if it 
weren't for the symbols; along the east wall of the Perimeter is 
painted a crude, red, encircled letter "A", and along the north 
wall is painted a bright pink heart. Respectively, they mark the 
south road as Anarchy Way and the east as Lover's Lane.

   A slew of trash blankets this street, rustling, crunching, 
squishing, and just generally offering all sorts of unappetizing 
sounds and sensations underfoot. It paves the street, with 
whatever other substance the street was actually paved with 
hidden far beneath layers of garbage. The road cuts east and 
west, wedged between the omnipresent Perimeter to the north and 
the houses to the south.

   A single word could be used to best describe this street: 
trashy. It coats the ground, sometimes ankle-deep, and just 
generally makes a mess of things. Graffitti is nearly as 
promenate, sprayed as high as an arm can reach, all over the 
Perimeter and the buildings to the south.

   The houses that line Lover's Lane to the south are not shoddy, 
though they are indeed run-down. Made of cement and steel, they 
run up together edge-to-edge, forming nearly as impenetrable a 
wall to the south as the Perimeter provides to the north. The 
street here is paved with trash - years of build-up providing a 
worse footing than whatever may be underneath, but also giving no 
choice.

it turns west into Lover's Lane. The homes in this area, built 
of cement and steel, are clearly of much higher quality than most 
in Grungetown. While they're still quite run-down, they are 
structurally sound, and their glass windows are largely intact, 
as is the street underfoot. Only light traffic passes through 
the area.

   This block of East Street is only a short stretch between the 
intersections of Lover's Lane to the north and North Street to 
the south. Few people pass through the area, and those who do 
rarely linger for long. A few scraps of trash tumble across the 
mostly-intact pavement. Once-pristine buildings stand along one 
side of the road, apparently abandoned long ago. To the east, 
the looming wall of the Perimeter cast the street in shadows for 
most of the day.

The Intersection of East Street and North Street~
   Ironically, East Street runs north and south here, and 
intersects North Street, which runs west as far as the eye can 
see. Caught between the battered homes to the west and the 
looming, metal wall of the Perimeter to the east, this area is 
cast in almost perpetual shadow, which adds to the desolate feel 
of the street given by the silence which permeates the area. 
Only a few people pass this way, and they rarely linger.

East Street Between North and Darkness~
   This stretch of East Street runs between a pair of 
intersections, with North Street to the north and Darkness Drive 
to the south. The residential area that rises to the west is 
relatively quiet, and built with better materials than most homes 
in Grungetown. Still, most walls are at least slightly battered 
and cracked, and quite a few homes appear forlorn and unoccupied, 
though their windows remain largely intact. The 
heavily-fortified wall of the Perimeter looms to the east, 
casting shadow over the area for most of the day.

The homes are of surprisingly good make, and while their

sound, with clean windows and no graffiti. There is rarely much 
of a crowd here, as most of the people who pass through prefer to 
continue on their way.

Lake to the south. The road is all but abandoned as the 
buildings lining the road to the east are in all states of 
deterioration, some burnt, little more than ashy husks while 
others have collapsed in upon themselves. To the west, a broken 
fence houses the numerous, residential shanties built within 
Wilmington Park, their exteriors built with scraps of metal and 
salvaged junk. 
   To the east is the Perimeter - a long ways away. Between here

   Old, concrete buildings have been partially restored and tuned

southwest corner, a metal fence encloses the vast sea of shanties 
built upon what was once Wilmington Park. There is often quite a 
few people milling about on the street corners and a number of 
them head east to where shouts and voices can be heard echoing 
from a small, billiards hall. Wilmington Way continues west and 
Revolutionary Way continues north though both streets run in 
their opposite directions towards the rim of Crater Lake in the 
distance.

Wilmington Way, West of Revolutionary Way~
   The wide road of Wilmington Way is so worn with age that 
barely any road still exists. What little of the pavement still 
remains has been riddled with pot-holes or covered with the thick 
layer of trash that has been compacted underfoot by passing feet. 
There is a stark contrast between the north and south sections of 
the road, derelict buildings to one side while to the south, the 
metal fencing of Wilmington Park surrounds the residential area 
that has been built within made up of sheet-metal shanties. The 
road continues west but to the east, a large intersection can 
easily be spotted.

   Revolutionary Way proceeds north and south, lined by 
dilapidated buildings constructed of rusting sheet metal. Dark 
and deserted, they cast shadows upon the visages of the few 
passersby. To the south, one store still seems to draw 
customers. 
   A thick cluster of old, ruined buildings lies to the east, 
impassable. Far beyond, in the distance, is the Perimeter. 
   Beside the western door is a small biometric scanner.

West of a Guns and Ammo Store~
   There are a few shops here run out of the remains of older, 
makeshift buildings, holes having rust through their sheet-metal 
ceilings so that light always filters down into the customers' 
faces as they browse along the street. Only one store seems 
maintained, standing to the east with a pair of crossed guns 
painted upon the door. The street continues north and south here 
along Anarchy Way as far as the eye can see and while many prefer 
to continue along their way, a few people do mingle upon the 
streets, this area rarely silent.

   The store to the east is obviously a guns and ammo store and

The door, obviously of older quality, has now rusted but yet more

Revolutionary Way, North of Wilmington Way~
   Anarchy Way runs south and north here of the busy intersection 
where it runs through Wilmington Way. The buildings that line 
the street here are abandoned, leaving behind the tattered shells 
of once-pristine buildings that continue to stand, a tribute to 
teh past. There are only a few people that pass this way though 
most prefer to continue along their way, keeping the area quiet 
save for the occasional 'click' and 'clack' heard echoing from 
the billiards hall to the east.

Outside a Noisy Establishment~
   Wilmington Way continues east here just past the large 
intersection it forms with Anarchy Way. The buildings 
surrounding the road are all manners of rundown some are burnt 
out, little more than ashy husks while some are collapsed in onto 
themselves or are derelict, boards lining windows and doors. The 
only building in use seems to be a small, billiards hall that 
stands to the north, loud shouts and voices echoing out onto the 
street. The rocky rim of Crater Lake has formed a somewhat 
higher ridge to the east, creating a wall that blocks the road 
from traveling further.

   The hall to the north is housed in a one-story building that

only decor. The loud, 'click' of billiards balls can be heard, 
echoing out into the street and pool tables can be spied through 
the door every time it opens.

Nearing the End of Umbra Road~
   The road is largely dust and gravel in his area, its uneven 
surface dotted by deep potholes, many of which are filled with 
pieces of compacted trash, a makeshift attempt at repairs. The 
western side of the street is lined by the remains of abandoned 
shops, crumbling cement walls standing in silent tribute around 
heaps of rubble. To the east, a metal fence encases the sea of 
cramped shanties packed inside what was once Wilmington Park.

End of Umbra Road at the Edge of Crater Lake~
   Umbra Road ends here, at the edge of Crater Lake. Most of the 
pavement in this area was long ago torn from the street, with 
only a few scraps remaining. Instead, a narrow trail of packed 
earth snakes east and west along the rocky rim of the crater 
where the ground is slightly elevated. The western side of the 
road is lined by abandoned shops with boarded windows and doors, 
but the eastern side is a sea of shanty homes, filling what was 
once Wilmington Park.

one can see barren moon land in the distance. Though it is too 
far to make out, movement can sometimes be seen at the other edge

Buzzard Boulevard meets Crater Lake. A few dilapidated homes and 
crumbling shops can be seen to the north, though the most 
noticeable building stands to the northwest, tall and relatively 
well-made and painted bright red. There are often a few people 
milling about the area, though hardly any venture east. To the 
south, the slush of the lake's surface glistens in the faint 
light, despite being mostly shadowed by the western wall of the 
Perimeter.

   North of this narrow trail, a number of crumbling concrete 
buildings have been haphazardly restored and turned into filthy 
shops. Graffiti is scrawled across most of the stained and 
pitted walls. The road itself is little more than hard-packed 
dirt, with loose trash and glass shards littering the ground. 
Bits of garbage float upon the toxic surface of Crater Lake to 
the south. The area is usually hushed, though urgent scuffling 
and short screams occasionally echo in from over the rooftops.

thin line of dirt and gravel packed down by countless passing 
feet. The path intersects Umbra Road to the east, but here it 
travels between the rocky, elevated ground of the crater's rim 
and the stretch of abandoned buildings to the north. The 
buildings are little more than crumbling cement, patched here and 
there with graffiti-covered sheet metal. Few people travel this 
way, but the occasional ratta-tat-tat of gunfire can be heard, 
echoing in the distance.

Edge of Crater Lake, West of Junkyard Row~
   This rocky path branches off to the west away from the main 
street of Junkyard Row to the east. It snakes along the curve of 
the crater's edge where water has formed a lake in the bowl of 
the depression. The surface of the lake is a thick gray sludge, 
and emits foul odors - even from here the smell is noticeably 
horrible. To the north, stopping a few feet away from the path, 
are the many run-down shanties that have been built upon what was 
once Wilmington Park.

Along the Edge of Crater Lake~
   The narrow path continues here east and west along the rocky 
edge of crater path. The ground underfoot is slightly elevated 
due to the crater's rim and unstable for the many shanties that 
have been built this far. The shanties themselves are already 
rather ramshackle, tacked together by any means possible and 
built out of sheet-metal and junkyard scraps. To the south, the 
icy slush of water that fills the bowl of the crater forms Crater 
Lake.

The Trail Bends East and South Along the Lake~
   Winding its way along the edge of crater lake, the trail is 
little more than well-trodden dirt in the ground with trash or 
glass shards tossed carelessly to the side. It avoids most of 
the higher elevation along the rim of the crater, though is 
limited by the sea of shanties that have been erected on top of 
what was once Wilmington Park to the north. To the south is 
Crater Lake, the surface of the water filled with icy slush. 
Deeper into the murky darkness of the lake can be noticed a 
greyed, solid block of ice. Every inch of it, ice or liquid, is 
a thick, poisonous-looking gray.

Edge of Crater Lake~
   Slum housing has been built rather close to the raised rim of 
the crater and so the rocky path here snakes southwards, 
extremely close to the edge of the lake. One house, having been 
partially-built on some of the elevated ground here, has 
collapsed in upon itself, leaving behind a pile of rubble. The 
rest of the homes are only a little taller than head-height and 
many of them are covered in bullet holes. The trail continues

Lake to the south. More trash is strewn around the shanties that 
crowd the area to the north, mostly domestic scraps tossed behind 
the homes without a care. The road itself is narrow and threads 
along the rocky, elevated ground of the crater's rim to avoid the 
glass-strewn area. A tense hush falls over the area, although 
the echoes of violence occasionally drift in from over the roofs.

A Path through the Park, East of Junkyard Row~
   Branching west off of Junkyard Row to the east is this narrow 
alley where shanties have grown outwards and upwards to cramp 
what little walking space there is, making it to where hardly 
three men could cross side-by-side. The homes are so 
closely-packed and of substandard quality that sound travels 
easily here, the sound of domestic fighting or music often heard 
echoing down the street. This road is so worn with age that 
barely any road longer exists while the asphalt has all been torn 
up and carted off, and the bit that remains is gravel. The path 
continues west, deeper into the park where more shanties have 
been erected. 

Over a plain, wooden door to the south hangs a sign depicting 
drugs, flavorings and chemicals.

   The road here is in poor condition, cracked and worn, clearly 
not maintained in years. The asphalt has all been torn up and 
carted off, and what remains is gravel and littered trash that 
has accumulated over time. Sheet-metal shanties stand nearly 
wall-to-wall on either side of the street and are filled with 
bullet holes old and new, some covered up by more more metal, 
others left to rust large holes. A few people, most of them 
bearing physical deformities, traverse this area and the 
occasional ratta-tat-tat of gunfire can be heard, echoing far 
off. The road continues west but to the east, the path seems to

multitude of potholes and trash, plastic wrappers and broken 
glass litters the ground, pushed up against the sides of the many

made out of scavenged junk tacked together by whatever means

   In the center of these slums a clearing has been left here 
where shanties have not been built, though many line the edge of

this is the entrance before Wilmington Manor. A metal-barred

Wilmington park. Lining both sides of the street are solid rows 
of shanties, more than one of the homes pockmarked with bullet 
holes and other scars, and sheets of metal have been used to 
repair many of the walls or roofs. Large cracks in the asphalt 
cause pieces of the road to be missing and other pieces standing 
straight up and the grayed pavement frays at the edges, worn

A Bend East and South through the Park~
   A crumbling road cuts jaggedly through the middle of this 
slum, worn almost to dirt. The grayed pavement frays at the 
edges, large chunks uprooted and peeling away from the dirt 
beneath. Potholes are a large commodity, no three feet of 
asphalt between one and the next. Lining both sides of the 
street is a solid row of shanties, each one little taller than 
head-height. The walls are made out of whatever materials seemed 
to be available at the time, tacked together by whatever means 
necessary. The path bends south and east through this park, more 
homes visible in both directions.

West of an Intersection in the Park~
   To each side of the road, ghetto housing has been erected by 
makeshift hands made of sheets of plastic or metal and no effort 
has been made to paint most of them. The homes are so 
closely-packed and of substandard quality that sound travels 
easily here, the sound of domestic fighting or music often heard 
echoing down the street. The road here is little wider than an 
alley, hardly wide enough that three people can stand 
side-to-side and shanties have grown outwards and upwards so that 
little else is visible except to the west where the road 
continues or east, where there is an intersection of paths in the 
distance.

An Intersection of Paths in the Park~
   Two, narrow paths intersect here in a small four-way through 
the park. Large cracks in the asphalt cause pieces of the road 
to be missing and other pieces standing straight up, the most 
noticeable being a rather large chunk of pavement uprooted in the 
center of the intersection that has been covered in graffiti. 
Lining both sides of the streets are solid rows of shanties, more 
than one of the homes pockmarked with bullet holes and other 
scars. In all directions, the roads continue through the mass of 
ghetto homes though far in the distance to the north, a larger, 
main street can be seen and to the south, the water of Crater 
Lake glistens in what visible light there is.

painted in neon-green color with a dark, red 'X' crossing out the

A Path through Wilmington Park, South of Wilmington Way~
   A deteriorating road, just wide enough for three men to stand 
side-by-side, branches off here through the slum that has been 
built upon Wilmington Park. Solid rows of shanties line both 
sides of the street, more than one of the homes pockmarked with 
bullet holes and other scars, and sheets of metal have been used 
to repair many of the walls or roofs. A few people pass here, 
making their way to their substandard homes, and the occasion 
ratta-tat-tat of gunfire can be heard, echoing far off. North 
leads to Wilmington Way while to the south, an intersection of 
paths can be seen.

A Side-Street Lit with Neon Lights~
   The street here is paved in old, black cement that is 
obviously ill-maintained, branching off from Buzzard Boulevard to 
the east. Little stores and round-the-clock shops have been set 
up along this busy side-street, but most of the traffic heads 
west to where loud music can be heard. However, most noticeable 
are the bright, neon lights flashing in the window of the store 
to the north, its sign reading "#DLe Sex Shoppe#0."

At the End of A Path of Shanties Lining Crater Lake~
   Here, the narrow path between shanties ends, leading to a 
small rise of ground upon which numerous homes have been built 
that nearly block the entire view of Crater Lake to the south. 
The homes are closely-packed and of substandard quality while the 
ground is in poor condition, cracked and worn, clearly not 
maintained in years. A few weeds have found purchase upon the 
rough ground of the Lake's rocky rim, creeping in towards the 
edge of the path though much of what is visible has been trampled 
underfoot. The calm waters of Crater Lake, visible past the 
higher ground of the old crater's rim, glisten in the light and 
to the north, one can see that the road intersects with another 
path through the park.

East of an Intersection in the Park~
   The shanties remain many in number as the path leads to a 
dead-end surrounded by more shanties that line the broken fence 
of the park to the east. The derelict homes are filled with 
bullet holes old and new, some covered up by more more metal, 
others left to rust large holes while others have been left to 
deteriorate, a few having collapsed only to be left as a pile of 
junk. This narrow road has had much damage done to it as large 
pieces of asphalt are simply missing.

   In the darkness of the looming perimeter wall to the west, 
this busy side-street ends. Many of the businesses here seem 
abandoned or incredibly ancient, their walls repaired with 
rusting sheets of metal or simply left as is, showing more 
buildings and darkened alleys beyond. Cat-calls and whistling 
can be heard alongside the pounding of music that beats out from 
the bar to the north and a handful of people always mill about 
its entrance where faded posters have been hung under the bar's 
electric sign, every single one of them showing off a voluptuous 
woman, or a pair of women, in little to no clothing.

A Short Side-Street Branching off Buzzard Boulevard~
   A narrow side-street branches west off of Buzzard Boulevard to 
the east. Shoddy buildings, many with cracked windows, line the 
street while others have been left abandoned, their insides 
having been visibly ransacked. The road is incredibly worn, 
weeds breaking the cement into wide cracks that have widened over 
time and what little of the asphalt is left has been reduced to 
gravel. No one dares pass this way and so the street is silent, 
only the occasional sounds of gunshots echoing through the area.

through the rubble and along the edge of the crumbled wall to the 
north though there is hardly a human or mutated soul seen passing

bottles can be seen, cast aside to the edges of the street and 
hampering one's travel through the area. A wide warehouse stands 
to the east, blocking one's view of any of the other abandoned 
buildings, its windows boarded up. The alley continues north and

clearly abandoned, empty husks with decaying roofs and collapsing 
walls. On the eastern side of the alley, however, light 
sometimes filters beneath the dented metal door of an intact shop

long caved in from some unknown catastrophe stands - barely - on 
its lonesome at the end of the line. The road is worn and 
ill-maintained, trash littering the sides of the street and 
compacted inside the pot-holes that scar the ground. There is 
little to no traffic along the road though the sounds of 
travelers upon the main road to the east echo into the area along 
with the ratta-tat-tat of occasional gunfire.

Along a Dark Side Street~
   The side-street continues this way, no lights strung or set up 
to illuminate the area for evening time which, in combination 
with the lack of real traffic here, creates a gloomy atmosphere. 
Graffiti has been marked heavily on the walls of the shops, even 
one accessory store that seems to still be in use to the north. 
The road here is ancient and in bad shape, almost all of it gone 
save a few pieces of pavement that once served as sidewalks. The 
alley continues to the west to where it intersects an even 
narrower alley in the distance.

Hardly a soul, human or mutant, can be seen here and combined 
with the lack of lighting to illuminate the area during the night 
time, creates a sinister feel. Absolutely no pavement exists 
here anymore underfoot, weeds having found their way through the 
rocky moon ground to sprout in the middle of the street. The 
side-street continues east to where a small store can be seen.

An Alley North of a Side Street~
   The alley heads from the south to dead end here behind old, 
concrete buildings. Like the rest of the alley and side-street, 
there are no lights strung about the area so in the night time, 
combined with the violent sounds of city, the area has a dark and 
sinister feel to it. Graffiti mars every inch of available wall 
space here and a pile of rubble and trash has been carelessly 
left here at the end of the alley, gathered up against the wall 
of the building to the north.

An Alley South of a Side Street~
   This side of the alley is significantly shorter than its 
counterpart visible to the north. It abruptly ends where 
someone, or a few someones, has piled all of their trash and 
refuse here behind the abandoned buildings and shanties, the 
stench of it wafting through the air. No one dares pass this way 
and so the area is all but silent save for the occasional screams 
of violence or ratta-tat-tat of gunshots heard echoing off in the 
distance.

A Side Street East of Junkyard Row~
   Branching east off of Junkyard Row, this side street cuts a 
path east through tiny, ramshackle shops and some abandoned 
buildings. To the east, the vendor stands and stores can be seen 
converging more tightly together and the sound of merchant calls 
echo in from the distance. Food wrappers and other garbage lines 
the street here, compacted underfoot on the weathered road. 
There is quite a bit of traffic that filters through here from 
the west, though most head east to where a small intersection can 
be seen.

A Four-Way Intersection of Side Streets~
   The street runs east and west while an even narrower side 
street cuts across it running north and south. There is a 
thickening in the number of shanty stands and ramshackle shops 
that have accumulated, most of the vendors selling many of the 
same, junk-like things in just a variety of type and quality. 
The shouts of the merchants and the haggling of the customers 
echoes down the street in a slight roar of sound, drowning out 
the sounds of the rest of the town.

An Alley North of Wilmington Way~
   This alley cuts a path north of Wilmington Way through a few, 
run-down shops, most of them selling junk or suspect-looking 
food. The road has all but weathered away to gravel and the 
rocky ground of the moon beneath though it is surprisingly level, 
the remaining asphalt having been pushed to the side to 
accommodate the steady flow of traffic that passes through this 
way. The alley continues heading further north towards a small 
intersection or south to the more popular road of Wilmington Way.

A Side Street Meets an Alley Running North and South~
   The alley is narrow, running north and south while a wider 
side-street branches off to the west for quite a distance, 
creating a small, three-way intersection here. Small stands have 
been erected within the remains of deteriorating, shanty-like 
buildings with their vendors calling out, trying to entice any 
travelers to see their wares of junk and suspect-looking food. 
To the north, a few people can be seen gathering around a 
ramshackle building though most of the traffic here flows west to 
more stores.

makeshift stalls of sheet-metal and plastic or fabric scraps 
displaying their wares of junk trinkets and suspect-looking food. 
There are quite a few people that travel through the area making 
the narrow street uncomfortable to travel through, one often 
brushing shoulders with other travelers. This stretch heads east

to the north. To the east and west of the streets, a few 
merchant stands line the way and call out prices to entice those 
who travel through the area. The most noticeable store is that 
of a used clothing shop to the west where hangers can be seen 
displaying some of the wares through the window. The street 
continues south to where it can be seen intersecting yet another 
side street through the market. 
   Beside the northern door is a small biometric scanner.

An Alley South of the Side Street~
   The number of merchant stands and stalls thin here as it 
approaches a small apartment complex to the east. The road here 
has deteriorated to gravel and the grey, rocky ground of the 
moon, none of the asphalt remaining. There are quite a few 
people that pass through here though most head north to where 
vendors and their stores can be seen converging near an 
intersection of side streets. The sound of merchants calling out 
their prices combined with the occasional domestic fight can be 
heard echoing onto the street.

   The alley continues here north and south, the asphalt 
underfoot having dwindled to nothing but gravel and the rocky 
ground of the moon. The buildings that stand to either side are 
all abandoned, all of the vendors choosing to set up shop further 
south. A single building remains in use here to the east, a 
few destitute-looking people, even by Grungetown standards, 
crowding around its door. The alley can be seen heading further 
north towards a bend though rarely any people pass in that 
direction.

of graffiti upon almost all of the visible wall space. It is 
rare than someone can be seen traveling down this road, most seen

   This alley is not much of an alley at all, the space allowing 
travel here formed solely because of the buildings to the east 
and west that have been rebuilt smaller upon their older, larger 
foundations. The travel here is quite cramped and hazardous, 
forcing one to clamber over piles of rubble. A small gap between

north is a short distance of alley though passage is hazardous 
because of the rubble of old, building foundations that have been

surrounded on all sides by tall rickety townhouses. All possible 
space has been cramped by the bleak gray houses, leaving only a 
small court. A dented drainage pipe leans up the side against 
one of them, the metal twisted outward. Overshadowed by the

- as though not a soul dwells here, or the inhabitants don't care 
to convince anyone otherwise.

A Dead End Outside the Sunshine Lounge~
   This short, featureless alleyway comes to a sudden end at a 
door. The street is little more than compacted trash, and the 
sides of the alleyway are featureless concrete - the sides or 
backs of the buildings that surround. Given the constant shadow 
provided by the Perimeter, the small space is rather dreary. In 
complete contrast to this atmosphere, however, is the eastern 
door; a bright yellow orb has been painted upon a blue background 
- clearly a sun, although the orb is crude and not entirely 
circular.

enclosed by the remains of collapsed, fire-ravaged shanties and 
shops. Rubble and trash cover the ground, wafting an unpleasant 
odor in the area and making it rather hard to pass through. The 
block appears to be abandoned, with no effort made to reuse any 
of the cramped, substandard homes or shoddy shops. People are 
rarely seen in this area of Grungetown, though a few are visible 
to the north, where Darkness Drive runs east and west under the 
shadow of the Perimeter.

   The alley twists north and east here, around the shattered 
remains of a shabby house that collapsed into the path. The 
street is buried beneath charred bits of trash and chunks of 
construction material, and one must step over the rubble in order 
to turn the corner. The remaining buildings are apparently 
abandoned, and are constructed of junk scraps and pitted concrete 
upon which fire damage is visible. The alley appears desolate to 
the east, while to the north it meets a larger road.

   The alley plunges deeper into the mass of fire-ravaged 
buildings, passing buildings which seem ready to crumble at any 
moment. Showers of cracked concrete fall occasionally from above 
as the remains of shabby stores and substandard homes tremble 
with even the slightest movement or touch. A faint rustling can 
sometimes be heard in the rubble, but people seem to avoid this 
place, and there is rarely a soul in sight. To the east, the

from the fire-ravaged buildings lining the alley is thick on the 
ground. This makes travel risky, especially when combined with 
the occasional shower of loose concrete that falls from above, 
crumbling from buildings which seem to be ready to topple at any 
moment. The only other sounds commonly breaking the silence are 
the occasional ratta-tat-tat of gunfire and the low murmur of

Atop the Northern Gatehouse~
   The trapdoor opens out to the top of the Perimeter, which 
allows a fine view - the monotonous gray of the moonscape 
stretches out beyond, and the ramshackle shanties of Grungetown 
lie behind. Forty feet tall if it is an inch, the most 
protection from falling offered is a flimsy, waist-high guard 
rail. A walkway made of riveted, rusty sheet metal lines the 
path between the rails.

At the End of the Hallway, 3rd Floor of the Buzzard's Beaker~
   Faint music from the club below drifts up into the hall while 
a red-shaded lamp casts an eerie glow throughout the length of 
the passageway. Doors lead to private rooms where moans and 
other dirty sounds can sometimes be heard through the walls but 
the hall ends here, only continuing southwards to the main 
staircase.

   This room is old and weathered, the walls cracked and painted 
in a faded, pale pink that has chipped in many places. The focus 
of the room is the queen-sized bed placed right in the center 
with a neon sign of '5' casting a soft glow around the entire 
room. The pounding of music can be heard coming up from the club

   Grime and dirt have been caked into the very cracks on the 
cement walls and floor of this kitchen. Though the counters and 
shelves seem to have been well-maintained, the rest of the room 
is in ill-repair with creaky cupboards and a small hole in the 
corner of the western wall, allowing the music of the club to be 
easily heard. There is a dual stove and oven against one wall 
that seems to have been rarely used but beside it is a large rack 
for bottles of alcohol. A small door to the north opens up into 
a pantry while the door to the south leads out into the hall.

The Wilmington Docks~
   The wide, weathered road of Junkyard Row leads in from the 
north to the edge of Crater Lake where the docks have been built, 
running over the rocky ridge of the crater's edge and into the 
thick gray, non-reflective surface of the water. Shanties can be 
seen, built closely to one another all along the coast to the 
east and west. To the south, all one can see, far off in the 
distance across the body of the lake, is the dead, uneventful 
land of the moon. The water is deep - several feet at least - 
the top layer is liquid, though mixed with an icy slush, and 
deeper down it becomes solid ice. Every last bit of it is toxic, 
a thick gray sludge that releases foul odors. The few people 
that dare to come this close to the foul body do not linger very 
long.

   The docks are made of metal with more metal sheeting and

   Run-down, but otherwise free of the dust that seems to plague 
most of the businesses in this dreary town, this shops walls are 
plastered with old magazine cutouts of men in the latest fashion. 
A small scrapmetal booth stands off to the southwestern corner of 
the room, an old dented cash register resting upon it. Shelves 
and racks sprawl in an unorganized manner about the shop, bearing 
the merchants finished goods, while an old worktable and sewing 
machine have been set up behind the booth, with crates of fabrics 
and patterns stacked underneath. The northeastern corner of the 
room has been curtained off with an old shower curtain and bears 
a sign with a blocky symbol of a man painted across it.

A Color-Organized, Used Clothing Store~
   All the clothes for men, women, and children have been mixed 
together in a nonsensical fashion and the only organization 
obvious is that they are all organized by color. All pants, 
shirts, and skirts of the blues are together while all the reds 
have been hung by the door. The rest of the colors are similarly 
organized on shelves and racks, the whole store from top to 
bottom filled with used clothing of various types. A counter 
covered in multi-colored fabric has been set up near the entrance 
with a register where one can pay for their purchases.

and in another corner tables have been arranged in a similar 
order. There seems to be no effort made into displaying the 
pieces and some already have been marred by the lack of care and 
attention given them by the store owner. There are hardly any 
customers within, the only sound inside the shop being the sounds 
of the park across the street.

fill the air, creating an almost choking atmosphere within this 
dingy business. A large worktable dominates the western portion 
of the shop, signs and hand-drawn diagrams depicting various 
nuts, screws, and bolts in a range of sizes and models. 
Peg-boards line the available wallspace and house a number of 
tools, most of them hand operated, with racks that shelve small 
plastic containers hold a myriad of fasteners ranging from the 
common staple to large deep-threaded bolts.

Lee's 24-Hour Liquor~
   Upon walking into the store, one will notice the gunshot 
through the main window first, then the vast array of colored 
bottles and cans that are arranged upon the many-shelved aisles. 
Despite the broken window, however, the building here seems to be 
in much better shape than the surrounding shops, with a fresh 
coat of green paint upon the walls and even a computerized 
advertisement display that flickers through various alcohol 
logos, though a few pixels have gone dark. Refrigerated display 
cases run along two of the walls as well, with single-serve 
liquors for sale and ready to drink.

quite plentiful, is set out in bins on the floor by type nearby 
the counter that runs along the far wall. There is even a small 
hunting section in the back of the store that shows off a wide 
array of hunting tools for every hunting need with the preserved 
head of a Barker hanging above it. With the number of things for 
sale, one hardly notices that most of the floor has been stripped 
out in exchange for cement and that door, which is made of heavy 
steel, also bears prison-like bars against it, making this 
building quite a fortification.

and random graffiti. Skeletal mannequins - cobbled pieces of

posters, while old, are still viewable, and they depict a variety 
of scenes including smoking camels, women in skimpy clothing, and 
alcohol. Other than the dirt, the shop is bare except for the 
large, glass display case where all of the shop's products line 
the shelves within.

The floor space is sparsely furnished, a pair of benches rest 
along the wall near the entrance, and a small desk has been set 
up between the rickety flights of stairs that lead upwards to the 
apartments. Small crowds of grungetownians bustle to and fro 
from the stairs to the entrance frequently, their hushed tones of 
gossip creating a quiet drone of background noise.

   Heavy traffic fills the market, as crowds of people hurry 
along with heads bowed, most of them staring at the ground, 
minding their own business. At odd intervals a Grungetownian 
stands away from the throng, surveying the wares of a haggard 
vendor. To the north, the Perimeter looms, impenetrable and 
foreboding, casting a constant shadow for many yards. The ground 
might once have been paved with asphalt - but that was a long 
time ago. Now it is naught but dirt and trash, beaten into shape 
by thousands of passing feet.

clustered about a series of ramshackle stores in the Market, 
buying and selling various smallgoods such as utensils, pots,

Market Around a Red and Gold Domed Theatre~
   The litter-strewn, traffic-busied market area stretches around 
a large, domed theatre here, its architecture seeming somewhat 
antiquated for the times with crimson-splashed concrete walls and 
think golden patterns for decoration. The traffic is somewhat 
scattered between rows of market stalls a little way out from the 
entrance to the theatre, leaving a large stretch of tarmac 
usually dotted with Denizens or spotted with clusters of people. 
In all cardinal directions the market stretches out, more busy 
than this strip with stalls and heckling vendors.

The Forges in the Market~
   The hustle and bustle diminishes here, as most Grungetownians 
stick to the perimeter of the marketplace, crowding near walls 
and down the occasional off-shoot alleyway. Instead of letting 
this free space go to waste, instead a series of forges, lathes, 
bellows and benches have been set up, a vibrant hub of Outland 
industry producing new weapons and wares from materials scavenged 
from the wastes. The trash on the ground is slightly less 
compacted, and collects in potholes and around low, deteriorating 
concrete stumps. Even in the relative calm, the murmur of the 
crowd is a constant drone, often punctuated by the hammering or 
quenching of metal.

The Edge of the Market~
   Interspersed unevenly around the marketplace is an occasional 
vendor, loudly hawking their wares to any that would listen, 
voices cut through and drowned out by other voices - more 
vendors, louder. The loudest of these is rewarded with more

The Market, an Intersection~
   The trash strewn on the dirt roads of the marketplace adds the 
stink of garbage to the sour smell of unwashed bodies. A few 
gaunt vendors hawk their wares to any who will listen, the 
loudest of them rewarded with the most customers. The 
surrounding buildings are dingy and cramped, constructed of 
crumbling concrete and rusting metal and warped plastic. A row 
of dark blotches stain a pitted concrete wall that is the only 
intact remnant of a collapsed building. 
   Darkness Drive splits off to the west, cutting through rows of 
shanties. It is barred by an iron gate, and you realize you must

Auction Rows in the Market~
   Traffic throngs through the market as crowds of people rush 
along, most of them staring at the ground, minding their own 
business. The insistent calls of vendors fill the air, and the 
occasional customer stops to survey the wares on sale. To the 
north, the Perimeter looms, impenetrable and foreboding, its dark 
shadow crossing the marketplace when the sun is low. The ground 
might once have been paved with asphalt, but that was a long time 
ago. Now it is nothing but dirt and trash, beaten down by 
thousands of passing feet.

The Center of the Market~
   The hustle and bustle diminishes here, as most Grungetownians 
stick to the perimeter of the marketplace, crowding near walls 
and down the occasional off-shoot alleyway. In the center here 
is an atypical two-story solid laid-stone building in the center 
of the market, a spire of metal latticework around a central 
metal column rising above it towards the sky. Guards stand on 
the wide, grey stone steps at all time, watching warily as 
occasional traffic goes through the archway above. Even in the 
relative calm, the murmur of the crowd is a constant drone, and 
the vendors can be heard yelling themselves hoarse to turn a 
profit; they are mostly ignored.

A Series of Ramshackle Stalls in the Market~
   The trash blanketing this area is constantly kicked about 
underfoot, a moderate-sized crowd of Grungetown residents 
clustered about a series of ramshackle stores in the Market, 
buying and selling various smallgoods such as utensils, pots, 
clothes, and hides. The sour stench of garbage still pervades 
the marketplace, but it is of secondary importance to the cries, 
squawks and shouts of the hawkers that operate their stalls here.

The Market, Beside Darkness Drive~
   Wedged between the Perimeter to the north and the abandoned 
buildings, half-demolished houses, and battered shanties that 
rise - and crumble - in the other directions, the marketplace 
appears surprisingly open. The flat expanse is broken only by 
the rickety stands of vendors, stuffed with all manner of wares. 
The vendors shout themselves hoarse trying to attract customers, 
and while a few people stop, the majority of the traffic 
continues onward, thick, hurried, and quiet. 
   To the east stands an iron gate, barring access to Darkness 
Drive. You realize you must #6CALL GATEGUARD#0 to proceed

The Edge of the Market~
   The filth-lined streets rustle as Gruntownians pass over them, 
the actual road being perhaps more trash-filled than the edges. 
Nearly ankle-deep, scraps of unmentionable material force the 
Grungetownians to step higher, crushing whatever their foot hits 
on the down-step further into the ground. This action creates an 
ever present rustle-crunch - background noise to an already noisy 
area. 
   A heavy throng of traffic passes through two massive doors to 
the west that lead into an equally massive building. Upon the 
door is painted a crude lizard, spitting a flame that takes up 
the majority of the door. Done in watercolors, it gives the 
illusion that the door is melting.

The Edge of the Market~
   Traffic hurries through the markets, heads bowed, nearly all 
staring at the ground, minding its own business. At odd 
intervals a Grungetownian stands, away from the throng, surveying 
the wares of a haggard vendor. To the north the Perimeter looms, 
as impenetrable as it is forboding, casting a constant shadow for 
many yards. The ground might once have been paved with asphault 
- but that was a long time ago. Now it is naught but dirt and 
trash, forced into shape by thousands of passing feet, all of it 
a dull grey. 
   A pair of massive double doors lead to a warehouse to the 
east, through which a heavy flow of traffic moves. Adorning 
these doors is a painting: a giant lizard is eating a bunch of 
what looks like organic material - a pile of greens and reds, 
hunks of plants and animals.

The Market, Outside of Firebreather~
   Winched between the Perimeter to the north and all manners of 
houses and shanties to the other cardinal directions, the 
marketplace stretches across, perfectly flat but for the stands 
of vendors, racked with all manner of things one might buy. 
People stop by these, or just pass them on by - the decisions of 
a few do nothing to change the decisions of the many, as the 
traffic continues at a near-constant basis, thick, hurried, and 
quiet. 
   To the west a pair of massive double doors lead into a 
warehouse, through which heavy traffic pours. Upon the doors has 
been painted a crude lizard in the act of ripping up chunks of 
metal and shoving them into its flame-filled maw. South, a 
large, three-story building has been erected in grand fashion as 
workers seem to put the finishing touches on the structure.

   Southwards stands a large, old warehouse, with a crude picture 
painted across the inwards-opening doors. The picture is that of 
two warriors, one red and one blue, battling to the death. While 
crude, the painter has obviously taken great care into the upkeep 
of the picture - amidst a swath of graffiti and dirt, the 
painting remains relatively untouched.

   Set firmly onto the edge of the market square, this warehouse 
stretches out long and wide, allowing a large number of people to 
crowd in at the same time - participants, spectators, and other 
traffic that flows from the marketplace, all filtering through 
the warhouse-turned-arena. Contrary to the look on the outside, 
this warehouse is fairly well-constructed, with sturdy walls and 
support beams and actually intact windows, here and there. The 
floors are covered in all manner of trash and the walls are 
scratched and marred, giving the place an altogether messy 
appearance. 
   Amidst the semi-controlled chaos is a betting booth, situated 
on the western wall, near the hallway that leads onwards. A 
golden coin is painted onto the wall above it, so as to prevent 
confusion. Southwards stretches another hallway.

Spektator Room 3~
   This is, quit simply, a steel-mesh cage that hangs from the 
ceiling by four chains, attached at each corner and rivetted to 
the roof. It sways with the movements of its inhabitants - often 
dangerously - and hangs a good ten feet above the arena below. 
The mesh is tight enough to support a fair amount of weight, but 
thin enough to allow a fairly easy view of the fighters below.

DELETED~
   This wide room does just barely enough to protect people from 
the elements - with walls and roof of rivetted sheet metal and a 
floor of wired steel mesh, it is created for a single sole 
purpose: Entertainment. While wide, the amount of people that 
cram into this room can make it seem particularly crowded, and 
the mesh floor often buckles dangerously beneath the weight of 
the spectators. Below the mesh can be seen the bloodstained rock 
of the arena floor. In the exact middle of the floor is a simple 
steel trapdoor, opening to a hacked stairway.

   Furnished comfortably, this lounge looks to be perhaps the 
single most expensive space in the entirety of the warehouse. 
The floor is covered in woven lizard skin, acting as a sort of 
carpet. From floor to sheet-metal ceiling, the four walls of 
this room are thick glass, scratched a bit but uncracked, 
providing a full view of the large arena around it. From here, 
any spectators could watch combatants rip each other to pieces 
from mere inches away, themselves perfectly safe.

The Permanent Power Room~
   This room contains all of the infrastructure objects for 
water, power, and whatever else might be added. It is set as the 
default room in oval0, oval1, and oval2 on the prototype outlets 
and faucets. This means that default-loaded outlets and faucets 
will all point here, and because the objects in this room 
shouldn't break down, they should never power-off. The 
Grungetown outlets and faucets that are hooked to the grid will 
have their ovals changed to room numbers that reflect the correct 
IG locations of the appropriate infrastructure.

A Machinery-Filled Room~
   A dull humming noise permeates this room, emanating from the 
large amounts of electrical equipment that line the walls. The 
equipment takes up nearly all the available space - wires can be 
seen snaking out between monitors or consoles, wiggled around 
machinery so as to be plugged into the outlets set within the 
wall. The constant presence of the large, humming machinery 
makes this room cramped and hot, with each added person only 
making it exponentially more cramped and hotter.

A Massive Pumpworks~
   This large space towers twenty feet before finding the ceiling 
above and at least that far in each other direction, though 
dimensions are difficult to determine through the mazeworks of 
metal and plastic piping that thrums and gurgles all around. 
Some larger pipes and massive pistons have worn markings of the 
old civilization on them, while many others seem refurbished and 
replaced over time, remolded from polyprop plastic or hammered 
iron alloys. The air smells of rust and pipe-fitting grease and 
the air feels consistently damp. The crushed-remains of ruined 
barrels litter the area, as a massive robotic crane moves back 
and forth on tracks above, scanning the floor.

A Large Electrical Relay~
   This station is quite large, needing quite a bit of room to 
house the equipment held within. It seems that most of that 
equipment is wires - the roof is absolutely covered in wires of 
all colors, stretching this way and that, held up by metal beams. 
These wires run to (and from) a series of pylons that stand in 
the center of the room, producing a dull hum. A winding stairway 
encircles the entire room, leading up and up the tower.

A Stained Sewer Chamber ~
   Stained and cramped stones clearly recognizable as the sewer 
make up the walls of the relatively spacious chamber, a metal 
hatch mounted securely to the wall to the south. The bottom of 
each wall is stained brown and black, the electronics placed 
clearly above the original water line, though recent 
modifications do stand on the floor. Heavy wires and cables have 
been shoved up through innumerable holes in the ceiling, pulled 
up into conduits that lead off primarily to the south and west.

   Electrical switch-gear, monitors, knobs and buttons dominate 
the entire western and southern walls of this Control Room. 
Along the northern wall a small desk has been built into the 
corner with a single chair of drab green. The floors, walls and 
equipment have been painted a utilitarian gray and seems to have 
been recently cleaned. The ceiling reaches high overhead, more 
equipment hanging from strut and all-thread near the walls. 
Cable tray hangs near a pair of stark fluorescent fixtures and 
plays host to snaking coils of cable and wire.

constantly threaten to ensnare or entangle the unwary. The very

cover this room, from small colored wires wrapped in bundles that 
snake across the ceiling to giant cables that crawl across the 
ground. the majority of them connect to the generator in the

The Corner of the Market~
   Heavy traffic fills the market, as crowds of people hurry 
along with heads bowed, most of them staring at the ground, 
minding their own business. At odd intervals a Grungetownian 
stands away from the throng, surveying the wares of a gaunt 
vendor. To the north, the Perimeter looms, impenetrable and 
foreboding, casting a constant shadow for many yards. The ground 
might once have been paved with asphalt - but that was a long 
time ago. Now it is naught but dirt and trash, beaten down by 
thousands of passing feet. 
   North Street heads westward, away from the Market, squeezed 
between the looming Perimeter and rows of shanties. 
   An iron gate bars the west, and you realize you must #6CALL

   This narrow tunnel is made tighter by the fact that it is 
halfway collapsed upon itself - stone clots up most of the room, 
and makes traveling through nearly impossible. Caved in walls 
block most paths of eggression, offering little more than a 
strict, linear path. Evidence that this was once a sewer stains 
the walls in browns and blacks; now, however, it is completely 
dry and stenchless.

A Narrow Crossroads~
   The tunnels here get slightly wider - but not very much. 
Concrete support columns have kept this section of tunnel from 
collapsing as badly as the rest, and a relatively small amount of 
debris litters the ground. Noticeable here is the gulley through 
which raw sewage once ran, now empty but for thick stains. 
Branching off from this vague crossroads, to the major cardinal 
directions, are tunnels, these less structurally intact.

Northern Gatehouse Surveillance Room~
   This room sits pretty securely inside the Perimeter wall. It 
is small, somewhat cramped, and fairly blank - the sheet metal 
and concrete combination that make up the walls, floor, and 
ceiling have absolutely no decoration. Along the northern wall 
is a bank of crude consoles; a handful of television screens are 
set into these metal hunks, and a few buttons line the tops of 
the bent metal. Thick wires are bound with more wires, running 
this way and that before disappearing into the floor.

Atop the Northern Perimeter~
   The top of the Perimeter allows a fine view - the monotonous 
gray of the moonscape stretches out beyond, and the ramshackle 
shanties of Grungetown lie behind. Forty feet tall if it is an 
inch, the most protection from falling offered is a flimsy, 
waist-high guard rail. A walkway made of riveted, rusty sheet 
metal lines the path between the rails.

Surveillance Room~
   This room sits pretty securely inside the Perimeter wall. It 
is small, somewhat cramped, and fairly blank - the sheet metal 
and concrete combination that make up the walls, floor, and 
ceiling have absolutely no decoration. Along the northern wall 
is a bank of crude consoles; a handful of television screens are 
set into these metal hunks, and a few buttons line the tops of 
the bent metal. Thick wires are bound with more wires, running 
this way and that before disappearing into the floor.

Surveillance Room~
   This room sits pretty securely inside the Perimeter wall. It 
is small, somewhat cramped, and fairly blank - the sheet metal 
and concrete combination that make up the walls, floor, and 
ceiling have absolutely no decoration. Along the northern wall 
is a bank of crude consoles; a handful of television screens are 
set into these metal hunks, and a few buttons line the tops of 
the bent metal. Thick wires are bound with more wires, running 
this way and that before disappearing into the floor.

A Narrow Alleyway~
   Rusted and battered sheet metal walls loom inwards towards 
this small alley, making it difficult for more than two to stand 
abreast within it and bottlenecking all travel to a single file 
line. The ground is almost entirely bereft of paving, the little 
bit of concrete left no more than a pitted, hardpacked crust. 
The alley continues on to the east, snaking it's way between the 
layers of ruined structures.

Along a Narrow Alleyway, Near a Ruined Shack~
   The alley opens up slightly here, cutting deeper into the 
ruins to the east. A rundown building to the north stands firm 
amongst the husks and collapsed forms of neighboring structures, 
it's windows long ago boarded over with pieces of worn plastic 
and bits of dented metal. A few dusty weeds struggle in the 
hardpacked dirt, forming gnarled root structures near the 
foundations of buildings and between the sparse stretches of 
paving, splitting it even further apart.

Upon the Slanted Roof of a Ramshackle Building~
   The patchwork, metal roofing of the shack slants downwards to 
the south, forming a slight incline and ridge to the north, 
running up against and being overlapped by the similarly slanting 
roof of an adjacent structure to the east. To the north, the 
street below runs east towards the innercity and west towards the 
eastern gates of the city.

A Sharp Turn In the Alley~
   The alley stops abruptly to the east as it runs up against a 
tangled mass of collapsed buildings and curves sharply to the 
south, coursing between the layers of yet more dilapidated 
buildings. The paving appears less worn here, with fewer 
sections missing, though a few scraggly weeds run along the 
insides of the cracked concrete and along its edges, little more 
than leafless stems and roots.

Deep in the Ruins, Near an Abandoned Shop~
   Collapsed walls and supports of adjacent buildings lean 
inwards along the cramped path, forming an open, impromptu tunnel 
of twisted metal above. To the south further travel is hindered 
by what appears to be an old, windowless, shop of some fashion, a 
faded billboard depicting a pair of crossed rifles. The outside 
is weather-beaten, rust and bullet hole patterns scattered along 
its front.

East of a Decrepit Shop~
   The alley stretches east to south here, snaking a rough path 
amongst the rubble. A layer of ruined structures, and beyond 
that, the Perimeter create an impassable maze to the east, 
blocking any further travel in that direction. To the south, the 
silhoutte of a large building stands against a backdrop of chaos 
and destruction.

   The narrow, weaving pathway continues its run north to south, 
the east and west completely blocked by rubble and ruins. To the 
south, the looming walls of a large building rise high, 
overshadowing many of the buildings around it.

Along the Side of a Large Warehouse~
   Large, concrete walls of a large structure rise high to the

riddled with faded graffiti. Along the upper edge of the wall, a 
horizontal row of rectangular windows begin at the southeastern 
corner and extend along the front.

Outside of the Entrance to a Large Warehouse~
   The alley widens significantly here, forming an empty lot 
outside the entrance to a sprawling warehouse. A pair of thick 
metal-reinforced doors mark the entrance, a large billboard on 
the concrete facing above them faded beyond recognition. The 
dirt and somewhat paved path continue on to the east.

An Open Space Beneath a Skeletal Building~
   A large open space expands outward beneath the remains of the 
left wing of the warehouse to the southeast. The walls long ago 
destroyed, only the thick metal frame remains, a skeleton of its 
former glory. The space beneath is bordered on all sides by the 
prevalent masses of layered buildings and tangled mazes of 
skeletal ruins, blocking all travel north, south, and west.

A Cramped, Abandoned Shophouse~
   Soot and burn marks coat the interior of this small storeroom, 
the metal walls beneath ripple outward and, in some places, are 
melted into a smooth slag. The flooring caves down to the dirt 
beneath near the eastern wall, slanting towards a large, 
jagged-edged hole that takes up the majority of the eastern wall 
and ceiling.

In a Narrow Pocket Between Buildings~
   This pocket between two buildings is just wide enough to 
accommodate one person - albeit just barely. It is narrow, 
rough, and dark, shadowed by its surroundings. To the east, the 
pocket visibly opens up into a wider crossing between buildings.

At a Narrow Dead-End~
   The pocket is abruptly stopped by the concrete wall of an 
adjacent building to the east. Thankfully it is wider than it is 
to the west, opening up to comfortably accommodate one person 
abreast. To the west is a narrow pocket between buildings.

A Bare, Concrete Hallway~
   This is a bare concrete hallway that runs off to the west. 
There is a low humming noise that emanates in the distance. No 
attempt at ornamentation has been made. It is dimly lit by 
light-lamps laid at regular intervals. A narrow stairway leads 
up in the northern wall. The solid poly-prop door is installed 
with a biometric scanner, and you realize you can #6HANDSCAN 
EAST#0 with proper permissions.

A Slitted Concrete Nest~
   This is a concrete gun-nest that can fit about ten people

defense, slits have been cut in the eastern wall to provide sight 
and the ability to fire down below. A metal shutter has been 
installed to the slit to close the slit or open it.

A Small Courtyard Among Cramped Shanties~
   Built on the ruins of toppled buildings, this whole area is 
awash in cramped shanties, filthy and dark, that are constructed 
of material cannibalized from the skeletal remains of the 
concrete and steel structures that once towered here. Most 
shanties appear abandoned, though fain scratching can 
occasionally be heard among the ruins.

Trapped Within a Metal and Glass Prison~
   This claustrophobic room is encased in metal and glass. It is 
numbingly cold here and strange gas fogs the stale air. Tubes 
jut out of the walls, some hanging limply and some broken 
all-together. The floor and walls of the room are shaped from 
some sort of metal-plastic alloy. At the front of the chamber is 
a glass hatch with a number inscribed upon its sleek surface. 
Beyond that lay only darkness.

High Rows of Velour-Covered Theatre Seats~
   The seats here - scarred with teeth marks, cigarette burns and 
chewing gum - have been covered in soft red velour, contributing 
to the overly dingy red glow which this theatre has been bathed 
in. A couple of small lightbulbs, housed in translucent red 
shades, line the crimson-splashed walls at the end of the rows. 
The stage seems to be somewhat far away from such a height and so 
far back in the theatre but you can at least see the performance.

Inside a Crumbling Shanty~
   This shanty has long gone unused, its walls and floor severely 
cracked and crumbling. All manner of refuse from soiled polymer 
clothing to plastic bags and cans line its edges. A corrugated 
iron roof sits precariously atop the walls, fastened in place 
with rusting metal brackets and a messy assortment of wires. In 
the near centre of the establishment sits a rusty iron grate, 
circular in shape, giving access to a damp, dark room below.

A Damp, Cold Cellar~
   The constant dripping of cracked, forgotten water pipes breaks 
the dead silence of this cold underground cellar. At several 
points around the edge of the room puddles of dirty water have 
accumulated and, in some areas, the dripping water has eroded 
into the broken concrete underfoot. For the most part the cellar 
floor has been covered unevenly with concrete and is cracked and 
broken in places. Every now and then one might hear the shuffle 
of footsteps or voices above through the rusted grate.

A Courtyard Before the Wilmington Manor~
   A well-trodden path leads in from the western slums and 
towards the grand entranceway of the Wilmington Manor, a stark 
contrast in living becoming immediately available. The courtyard 
itself has seen better days, with rubble spread about and 
bulletholes adorning several of it's previously grand features. 
Still, it serves it's purpose, with benches allowing for 
semi-comfortable seating and the open area allowing ample room 
for get-togethers when necessary.

A Large Wood-Floored Shop~
   This simple building is large for a shop, with scuffed 
hardwood floors and walls and ceilings composed of the same 
ridge-textured flimsy metal. About five feet directly in front 
of the entrance a small counter stands isolated, with the room's 
singular light dangling from a cord above. On either side of 
this counter is a dingy metal shelf, each decorated with an 
assortment of sour-smelling glass vials; many of them have been 
set with yellow stickers, on which deftly hand-drawn symbols in 
black ink depict a skull, a fire, fumes or any combination of the 
three. Hanging from the light fixture is a sign that reads 
"Drugs, Flavorings and Other Chemical Compounds". With no 
windows and minimal cracks in the walls, several square feet of 
the room empty, making the footsteps echo and conversations buzz 
ominously. Several feet back through the darkness rests a heavy 
metal door, set in a wall that has been crudely but effectively 
reinforced by welding.

A Plain Living Room~
   The hardwood floors lead into a smaller room, where thick 
cloth blankets of various dark colors have been drilled into 
three of the walls, providing some small relief from the dreary 
metal. From this side of the store's back wall, it's clear that 
this building was once a single room, likely serving as a storage 
building or a small warehouse. As such, there isn't much to see 
beyond a crudely installed sink. The fourth wall bears a heavy 
metal door, leading to what is likely half of the building's 
remaining space. The place is kept immaculately cleaned and free 
of any foul odors.

A Spartan Storage Room~
   All hardwood flooring and cold metal, this room is empty and 
clean. The sour, biting scent of chemicals wafts from stain 
marks on the floor. Any sound made in this room tends to induce 
a buzzing echo. A singular light hangs from a fixture, limply 
swaying above the quiet floors.

A Gap Between Two Shanties~
   This small gap, not even an alleyway is very narrow, barely 
for people to squeeze through single-file. It has been covered 
up by a corroded sheet of plastic to the west and on the ground 
is a metal hatch leading down with a handscanner next to it.

A Bunker-Style Radio Station~
   The walls, ceiling and floor of this room are concrete and are 
stained in browns and blacks at the bottom. Although this was 
clearly part of the sewer once, it no longer has any stink to it. 
A metal ladder leads up to a hatch in the ceiling with a 
handscanner next to it. Somewhat spacious for it's purpose, this 
room is filled with radio equipment and other electronic gear. 
One wall is partially taken up by a couple of wide lockers and 
there is a single plastic chair sitting in front of a display 
with various readouts and a microphone plugged into it. A bundle 
of cords lead off the equipment and disappear into the wall 
behind it.
