Base Room for Grungetown (Indoor Rooms)~
This sector is for expansion of building interiors within Grungetown.

56001 - 56199 = Anarchs
56200 - 56399 = Shadows
56400 - 56599 = Wilmingtons
56600 - 56799 = Vultures

Reliable ranges are needed for echos and progs. If 200 rooms isn't enough, we'll annex another zone.

Type RUNUSED to see what numbers are available for use.

A Dimly-Lit Gambling Den~
   This room is rather dimly-lit with lights hung from the walls 
covered in opaque glass that casts a red glow around the room. 
Gambling tables are positioned here and there with various games 
and are perpetually occupied with at least a half-dozen players 
at hand. The walls are bare and there are no decorations save 
the rather large, deformed, stuffed dog that has been positioned 
next to the entrance to the den right at the base of the stairs, 
its face frozen in a harsh snarl.

Doghouse Bar~
   This room is rather dimly-lit with lights hung from the walls covered in 
opaque glass that casts a red glow around the room. Patrons wander in and out 
of the bar with varied pace, but the atmosphere of the establishment seems 
rather chilled. Various Family members lounge around in their own corners, 
mainly keeping to themselves, though a few can be spotted at tables not 
populated mainly by their own. A sign sits about the southern door, a crude 
picture of a toilet, and along that wall is a rickety plastic staircase, 
leading upwards. Above the northern door to the building is mounted a barker 
head - the head is as large as a man's chest, black-furred, with its face 
perpetually pulled into a vicious snarl.

A Spacious, Brown-Carpeted Office~
   This room is quite spacious, with weathered metal shelves 
that loom in the far corner of the wall filled with a few 
knick-knacks, and a creaky ceiling fan hanging from the center of 
the room. The paint on the walls is faded and chipped, much 
like the rest of the building, but the floor is covered in a 
shaggy, dark-brown carpet - its age obvious due to the missing 
patches of fabric here and there. The carpet changes to 
scratched flooring in the corner near the shelves where a 
large desk filled with many drawers and cabinets stands.

A Rack-Lined Hallway~
   Just like the commons, this hallway is fairly ancient; the 
paint on the walls somewhat less faded albeit in the same, 
chipped state. One stuffed dog has been posed in a sleeping 
position at the far end of the hallway as if watching the 
passerbys, and otherwise the hallway remains bare. The waxy 
sheen on the floor is incredibly dull here due to the heavy 
traffic coming in and out of the kitchen doors to the east. 
Signs are set above the western and southern doors - the former 
is that of a stick figure, and the latter is a stick figure with 
a skirt.

A Weathered, Tile-Floored Kitchen~
   This kitchen seems to be the remains of what was once a rather 
professional-looking kitchen. The shelves and counters, now 
dented and dinged, are made of some shiny metal alloy, and the 
floor is covered in faded blue tiles, most of which are cracked 
so that the cement foundation peeks through here and there upon 
the ground. The walls are now a dingy, grey color with black 
smoke marks above the stove while various pots and pans hang from 
racks affixed to the ceiling. A large freezer has been built 
into the room, taking up most of the eastern wall and to the 
north is the narrow door to the cupboard.

Inside A Narrow Cupboard~
   Cramped, narrow, and a literal box. This cupboard can fit 
only one average human comfortably at any time. Shelves line all 
of the grey concrete walls. Should one look carefully, a small 
gray door is set behind shelving to the east.

A Color-Organized, Used Clothing Store~
 Every article of clothing in this clothing store has been 
previously owned, and mixed together in a nonsensical fashion, 
though they all appear to have been arranged by color. While 
garments in various shades of blues lines the shelves on one side 
of the store, the reds have been put on display by the door. The 
rest of the clothes on the racks and remaining shelves have been 
organized in a similar fashion. A counter covered in a 
multi-colored fabric has been set up near the entrance with a 
register where one can pay for their purchases, and various 
knick-knacks and baubles on display.

The Commons of the Shelter~
   While easily one of the largest rooms within this 
establishment, the commmons has obviously seen better days. 
Where walls would otherwise be missing, thick sheets of metal 
have been welded in their place to keep the elements out. Areas 
of the roof, especially over the kitchen, have begun to 
deteriorate, though provisions have been made to ensure it 
doesn't collapse in any time soon. Along the far wall opposite 
of the entrance is the kitchen and dining area, tables with long 
benches dot this area, capable of accommodating many. The rest 
of the room appears to be used for any and everything, with 
shelves and bins lining their walls. A small hallway branches 
off the room to the east, leading to rest of the shelter; the 
western door is the only way back out into the alley.

A Door-Flanked Hallway in the Shelter~
   This small hallway branches off from the main commons of the 
shelter, which lies to the west. The walls are bland, and the 
tiled floor is dusty with mutiple pieces missing. A set of 
doors, one pink and the other a dark blue, leads to two separate, 
single-sexed dormitories. At the end of the hall lies a wide 
doorway, though a heavy black tarp prevents one from seeing 
what's behind it.

West Street, South of the West Gate~
   Stretching toward the southern wall of Grungetown, West Street 
continues past a long-abandoned cluster of buildings that blocks 
any travel eastwards. Most of the buildings have toppled into 
rubble or are skeletal husks of walls and floors. The few 
buildings still standing are heavily boarded, and tagged with 
layers of graffiti. A scattering of trash covers the 
pothole-ridden pavement in the near-constant shade of the 
Perimeter that looms to the west. The busy clatter of West Gate 
sounds to the immediate north.

A Private Den~
   Curtains of thick, black fabric section off padded booths 
along the walls of this den, allowing paying customers to spend 
some private time with the dancer of their choosing. Against the 
far wall, a small, circular stage has been built with only a few 
comfortable seats circling it, the lighting in the whole room 
soft and atmospheric. The music is quieter here though it can 
still be heard drifting in from the main area of the club to the 
south and there are significantly less patrons.

   This hallway has been painted entirely black, creating an 
almost sinister feel to the already dark passageway. A single 
door to the north bears the sign 'Employees Only' and the only 
other exits are towards the music-filled room of the Buzzard's 
Beaker to the west or towards 'Le Sex Shoppe' to the east whose 
bright neons shine into the hall.

dents upon the desktop. When the wall lamp is lit, it only 
illuminates the dirt that has accumulated over the years between 
the grayed tiles of the floor. There is a bare window on the far 
wall with a large crack in the glass, the curtain rod gone from 
its hooks.

tile floors of this small dressing room. Cubbies line one wall 
with hooks inside bearing frilly robes and undergarments while 
the wall directly opposite the door has been turned into a series 
of make-up stations, mirrors hung above short tables covered in 
bottles of perfume and makeup in a variety of colors and types. 
A series of lightbulbs have been affixed along the top of the 
stations, casting a bright glow around the entire room and the 
only exit is a thin door to the west.

second floor of the Buzzard's Beaker.

   Grime and dirt have been caked into the very cracks on the 
cement walls and floor of this kitchen. Though the counters and 
shelves seem to have been well-maintained, the rest of the room 
is in ill-repair with creaky cupboards and a small hole in the 
corner of the western wall, allowing the music of the club to be 
easily heard. There is a dual stove and oven against one wall 
that seems to have been rarely used but beside it is a large rack 
for bottles of alcohol. A small door to the north opens up into 
a pantry while the door to the south leads out into the hall.

The floor is made of concrete but there are numerous cracks, even 
chunks missing that provide hazardous travel for customers. 
Shelves and hooks are aplenty here displaying a variety of 
sundries for sale though there is little organization to how they 
are arranged. A dented, metal door leads west back out into the 
alley.

A Humid, Dingy Kitchen~
   Although this kitchen has been built roomily enough, the 
concrete foundations have done nothing to alleviate the humidity. 
With constant cook-fires, much of the heat has been trapped 
inside the room itself, and only a few small vents on the ceiling 
provide much needed airflow. Grime and dust collects in the gray 
tiled flooring, and on every nook and cranny visible. Though the 
decor is maintained poorly, the tables, stoves, and shelves are 
kept relatively clean.

North of a Bend in the Alley~
   This cramped alleyway is wedged between two buildings, filled 
with trash and other detritus. A light smattering of grafitti 
runs across the walls of the buildings, but it isn't quite as 
heavy as other places in the town. Buildings line either side of 
the street, wedged tightly together, offering no room for anyone 
to pass.

Nearing a Dead End~
   North and south, this alley can be seen coming to an end - 
north it deadends, and south it bends harshly, a smooth ninety 
degrees. Trash and other detritus litter the ground, not 
allowing a single step without landing atop some unsavory 
substance, while grafitti similarly covers the walls. Overall, 
it is a fairly dirty little alleyway.

north to south, the way is lit by the occasional sparse diode. 
The light flickers now and then, and shadows skitter. It comes 
to an abrupt end to the north, meeting only solid cement.

nook and cranny available in the room. Shelves line the walls 
filled with bins of loose wires and old keyboards while the 
shells of computer towers and various electronic pieces such as 
circuit boards and resistors are all messily, but logically 
organized for display for the customers, forcing them to have to 
dig through boxes to find what they're looking for. A single 
desk with a heavily-modified computer sits in the dark in the 
very back of the store with a register nearby, obviously the 
place to pay for one's items.

The Sunshine Lounge~
   This lounge is fairly roomy and crowded, considering the 
alleyway that led into it. While composed mostly of concrete, 
extra care and attention has been gone into making the room as 
comfortable as possible. A soft-brown, polymesh carpet has been 
laid across the floor, and various pictures and posters, all of 
different ages, adorn the walls, adding color to the otherwise 
flat grey. A plastic bar runs along the southern wall, and rows 
of couches run across the floor, providing seats for whoever 
needs them.

London Syndicate Shop - Medical Supplies~
   As a stark contrast to the filth of Grungetown, this shop is 
coldly crisp and clean. There is an unnerving precision of how 
all wares are placed on the shelves, perfectly lined up as though 
a machine arranged the entire place. All medical products have 
been placed behind a wired wall, behind the counter to prevent 
any thievery. The walls are a bland white and the floor is a 
nondescript gray. It would be completely devoid of any 
ornamentation if not for a large red cross painted in the centre 
of the floor - if it can be called decor.

plastered with old magazine cutouts of men in the latest fashion. 
A small scrapmetal booth stands off to the southwestern corner of 
the room, an old dented cash register resting upon it. Shelves 
and racks sprawl in an unorganized manner about the shop, bearing 
the merchants finished goods, while an old worktable and sewing 
machine have been set up behind the booth, with crates of fabrics 
and patterns stacked underneath. The northeastern corner of the 
room has been curtained off with an old shower curtain and bears 
a sign with a blocky symbol of a man painted across it.

   Furnished comfortably, this lounge looks to be perhaps the 
single most expensive space in the entirety of the warehouse. 
The floor is covered in woven lizard skin, acting as a sort of 
carpet. From floor to sheet-metal ceiling, the four walls of 
this room are thick glass, scratched a bit but uncracked, 
providing a full view of the large arena around it. From here, 
any spectators could watch combatants rip each other to pieces 
from mere inches away, themselves perfectly safe.

A Spectator's Room~
   This wide room does just barely enough to protect people from 
the elements - with walls and roof of rivetted sheet metal and a 
floor of wired steel mesh, it is created for a single sole 
purpose: Entertainment. While wide, the amount of people that 
cram into this room can make it seem particularly crowded, and 
the mesh floor often buckles dangerously beneath the weight of 
the spectators. Below the mesh can be seen the bloodstained rock 
of the arena floor. In the exact middle of the floor is a simple 
steel trapdoor, opening to a hacked stairway.

A Sheet-Metal Hallway and Viewing Room~
   This hallway is wide and crudely-constructed - it is a 
sheet-metal addition to the eastern warehouse, branching off and 
moving on westwards. The floor, starting just at the hallway's 
beginning, is steel mess, bent downwards from the constant 
trampling underfoot. Below are are two cramped, bloodstained 
rooms - the fighting pits, the one-on-one arenas - and the floor 
is kept fairly clean, so as to allow the viewing of the 
combatants below. A metal spiral stair leads up to a door above.

Ice Nine Accessories~
   This shop is nigh on crumbling. Constructed archaically using 
plastic boarding, the shop itself appears to be slanting inward. 
Plastic boards that may have once been white - now a questionable 
yellow - are splintered and torn, and some lean inward on the 
ceiling. Indeed, all that holds it up appears to be cement 
pillars set in the walls. Despite its deteriorating condition, 
the counter is kept curiously clean and nearly sparkling white. 
Equally clean shelves behind the counter hold numerous 
accessories, polished to a glow. A rectangular black sign above 
the counter bears the shop's logo: a fading blue block, 
resembling ice, and the numerical "9" by it.

A Messy Warehouse~
   Set firmly onto the edge of the market square, this warehouse stretches out 
long and wide, allowing a large number of people to crowd in at the same time - 
participants, spectators, and other traffic that flows from the marketplace, 
all filtering through the warhouse-turned-arena. Contrary to the look on the 
outside, this warehouse is fairly well-constructed, with sturdy walls and 
support beams and actually intact windows, here and there. The floors are 
covered in all manner of trash and the walls are scratched and marred, giving 
the place an altogether messy appearance. 
   Amidst the semi-controlled chaos is a betting booth, situated on the western 
wall, near the hallway that leads onwards. A golden coin is painted onto the 
wall above it, so as to prevent confusion. Southwards stretches another 
hallway.

The Betting Booths~
   Considerably cleaner than the warehouse from which it 
branches, this small room is kept fairly spartan. A trapdoor is 
set into the south-end of the floor, and just to the left of that 
trapdoor is a booth, and painted along either side are large 
warriors that stand at attention, facing the crowds; one is 
painted red and the other is painted blue.

A Quiet Warehouse Filled with Furniture~
   The furniture here has been organized by type - in one corner 
sits chairs of the same design, all stacked one atop the other - 
and in another corner tables have been arranged in a similar 
order. There seems to be no effort made into displaying the 
pieces and some already have been marred by the lack of care and 
attention given them by the store owner. There are hardly any 
customers within, the only sound inside the shop being the sounds 
of the park across the street.

The Prep Room~
   Crudely hacked out of the surrounding stone, this room is 
tight, cramped, and more than a little lopsided. Rows of racks 
line the walls, bolted or otherwise leaning against the stone, 
stacked in heaps with armor and weapons that are, more often than 
not, just cast haphazardly about on the ground around the racks. 
A single heavy door is set on the western wall, cleverly designed 
to be opened only from the inside.

A Dirty Operating Room~
   This small room consists of two operating tables, both of them 
rusty and stained, and an incredibly dirty sink. The stone 
beneath the tables has been dyed a dark brown from perhaps 
gallons of blood, and the stains lead back and forth from those 
to the aforementioned sink. A lone, bare lightbulb flickers in 
the center of the room, providing a dim yellow that casts lengthy 
shadows.

A Musty Tool Shop~
   The musty aroma of motor oil, metal polish, and dust mingle to 
fill the air, creating an almost choking atmosphere within this 
dingy business. A large worktable dominates the western portion 
of the shop, signs and hand-drawn diagrams depicting various 
nuts, screws, and bolts in a range of sizes and models. 
Peg-boards line the available wallspace and house a number of 
tools, most of them hand operated, with racks that shelve small 
plastic containers hold a myriad of fasteners ranging from the 
common staple to large deep-threaded bolts.

   This crude stone tunnel is hacked east-to-west, the tool-marks 
still visible on the walls. A single bare lightbuld casts a 
yellow glow over the dull gray stone, flickering occasionally, 
weak. A metal door is set into the northern wall, the number one 
crudely painted across its surface.

Vultures' Apartment Complex~
   An overwhelming odor of soot and charred plastic lingers in 
the air of this small, crudely repaired complex. Hints of fire 
damage can be seen in melted sections of the walls plastic 
sheeting and large black smudges that run along the ceiling of 
the crowded foyer that makes up the ground level of the building. 
The floor space is sparsely furnished, a pair of benches rest 
along the wall near the entrance, and a small desk has been set 
up between the rickety flights of stairs that lead upwards to the 
apartments. Small crowds of grungetownians bustle to and fro 
from the stairs to the entrance frequently, their hushed tones of 
gossip creating a quiet drone of background noise.

A Guns and Ammo Store~
   Weapons of every type have been set on display in this 
deteriorating building. Along the walls, various shotguns and 
rifles are hung behind a cage display while smaller handguns and 
knives are set out inside of a glass counter. Ammo, which is 
quite plentiful, is set out in bins on the floor by type nearby 
the counter that runs along the far wall. There is even a small 
hunting section in the back of the store that shows off a wide 
array of hunting tools for every hunting need with the preserved 
head of a Barker hanging above it. With the number of things for 
sale, one hardly notices that most of the floor has been stripped 
out in exchange for cement and that door, which is made of heavy 
steel, also bears prison-like bars against it, making this 
building quite a fortification.

   With a ceiling of steel mesh, sunken in places from spectators 
above, this arena is a fairly large, hacked out square. The 
walls and floor are rough, jagged stone, splattered with old 
bloodstains, spit, sweat, and dust. Bare lightbulbs hang 
randomly about, often low enough to be right in the faces of 
fighters, and many of these are broken, the glass long since 
pounded to dust. In the very center of the killing ground sits a 
box made entirely of thick, scratched, bulletproof glass, and 
within that is a fairly comfortable-looking lounge.

Sassy Lassy Co.~
   Plastic peach-colored models protected by tall transparent 
cases mark this as a clothing shop. All manners of clothing are 
demonstrated by the models, from rugged solar radiation-resistant 
sleek dusters, to revealing dresses designed to accentuate 
feminine beauty. The shop itself is kept in great order. Its 
interior is painted a mellow beige, and the floor is 
brown-boarded as though to mimic wood. The wide counter is set 
in the back, and all actual clothing to be bought is stored 
behind it behind a thick glassy case. Sassy Lassy Co.'s logo is 
painted on the counter itself: a vague female face grinning and 
winking.

The Buzzard's Beaker~
   Music constantly blares from a speaker on the stage which is 
the main focus of the entire room, spotlights highlighting a 
silver stripper pole set before a wall of mirrors. Two smaller 
stages are set to the right and left but are lit only half as 
bright with a string of chairs arranged along the edge of all 
three performance areas. The rest of the room is cast in dim 
lighting or near darkness where other tables or seating have been 
placed for customers to view the scantly-clothed dancers. A bar 
runs along one wall, out of the way and near the entrance, with a 
few hundred bottles, empty and filled, lining the shelves. There 
is a constant flow of activity throughout the room with some of 
the dancers disappearing upstairs with paying customers or north 
to where a private viewing area is blocked off.

and dirty, the walls bearing a number of crudely patched holes 
and random graffiti. Skeletal mannequins - cobbled pieces of 
scrap and junk metal - are set about the dusty shack bearing the 
merchants finer wares, while the more common and affordable items 
hang along the wall behind the counter or lie in disorganized 
piles upon the floor.

La Revolucion~
   A thin haze of tobacco smoke clouds the atmosphere of this 
small establishment, carrying the scent of sweat and cheap 
alcohol. An "L" shaped bar takes up most of the northern part of 
the common room, it's end stopping just short of the northern 
doorway. A few rough barstools sit scattered about it, some 
bearing the hunched forms of patrons, while others lie stacked 
seat down upon the floor. A pair of worn billiards tables have 
been set up a few feet apart from each other beneath a hideous 
plaque-mounted Barker's head. The only clear floorspace marks 
the outline of a trapdoor set flush with the floorboards. Groups 
of patrons mill about, gossiping, and the occasional burst of 
raucious laughter can be heard echoing about the room.

A Heady-Scented Smoke Shop~
   The heady scent of cigarettes and other smokey flavors fill 
the air, almost overbearing to one's senses. The shop is 
incredibly run-down and dirty, with small holes or cracks in the 
wall visible running behind the many, ancient posters. The 
posters, while old, are still viewable, and they depict a variety 
of scenes including smoking camels, women in skimpy clothing, and 
alcohol. Other than the dirt, the shop is bare except for the 
large, glass display case where all of the shop's products line

   Oddly well-maintained, this stone building is clearly of original 
manufacture by technology now beyond reach, smoothly mitered and well-joined 
stone making the walls and floors. The chamber is perfectly round, surrounding 
a central metal pillar that rises through both ceiling and floor. Translucent 
triangular plastic panels make up the high ceiling almost twenty feet overhead, 
concealing the workings beyond from view, but allowing the arcing electricity 
and whirling lights being generated there to cast their illumination through. 
The thick walls insulate from the cacophony beyond, the rhythmic sound of 
gears, gyros, and arcing power conduits providing an almost soothing 
syncopation.

structure appears unaffected by the damage.

   Twisted, unstable metal comprises the entirety of the 
shophouse ceiling. It pops, pings, and groans in protest when 
under pressure. The footing is precarious as one proceeds 
farther from the gaping ceiling hole, and only an outcropping of 
rubble to the east offers further passage.

A Flat Outcropping of Rubble~
   By some chance, rubble and metal toppled in such a way as to 
provide a relatively flat platform to stand upon. Much like 
everything else near these ruins, crumbling rock, bent and warped 
metal, and indistinguishable material has formed this platform. 
It slopes upward to lean against another scored building's 
ceiling, ruined and blackened by soot.

A Shabby Kitchen~
   This concrete room is not much different from a cell. There 
are now windows, and the only door leads out into the lounge. It 
is obvious that this is where all the preperation work for 
whatever goes on outside happens. There is space enough to work 
and, perhaps, for an employee to nap but not much else other than 
storage.

A Cramped, Noxious Dead End~
   For whatever reason, rubble has been piled up on the southern 
end of this tight, little alleyway. While the alley does not go 
anywhere, it does provide an inconspicious place to watch 
passersby on the street. The limiting factor is how long one can 
stand the stench of the rubbish that has been piled in.

   The going is dangerous on this townhouse roof. With no stable

cheap concrete - a literal square. Spidery cracks run along some 
portions of it, and it has surely seen better days. It is 
enclosed on all sides but the north by taller square buildings of 
the same make. The western building's walls are scored with 
holes, notably caused by bullets, old age, and otherwise.

The Firebreather's Pit; The Metal Eaters~
   The interior of this large building is never empty - there are always a 
number of people coming and going, a handful more people loitering to carry on 
conversation, and others that just wait silently for their turn. Perpetually 
here are the workers that tend the Firebreather; barrel-chested, burly men that 
collect metal scrap from the townsfolk and feed it into the mechanical monster, 
then divvy out the materials produced. These men are a blend of denizens, 
mutations, and cybernetics, and all are covered in soot. The thick layer of 
ash makes all the men equal - walking black giants with indistinguishable 
features that lug the offered scraps of metal to and fro. The atmosphere that 
surrounds the salvaging activities is somewhat claustrophobic, but everyone 
inside appears to generally be at ease, despite the cramped space that the 
large crowd causes.

The Firebreather's Pit; The Cloth Turners~
   This room is a flurry of activity as raw cloth material is 
processed and fed into the Firebreather: a crocodile-like machine 
with cloth-spines protruding out. Here workers are constantly 
switched in in alternating shifts, carrying crates to and from 
the Firebreather, feeding the material through its maw. It is 
rather busy and cramped, as business always rages. The air is 
thick and hot.

The Firebreather's Pit; The Plastic Burners~
   While the traffic here is thick, it is not quite as thick as the traffic 
that runs through the other Firebreather buildings. This is, perhaps, owing to 
the haze of black smoke that hangs around inside the building and the chemical 
smell of burning plastic. The smoke and smell come from behind the roped-off 
firebreather, pouring out in thick layers that a large hole in the ceiling 
ultimately fails to ventilate. Around the Firebreather are the Plastic 
Burners, bulky figures covered head-to-toe in thick, black leather, with faces 
obscured by crudely made gas masks. Faceless, these figures march about their 
duties in an organized fashion, offering nothing else in the warehouse any 
attention but the mechanical lizard. Curiously, some of these figures are 
missing a single hand or foot, with nothing but an empty glove or boot covering 
it. If one were to pay enough attention, they would notice gruesome scarring 
beneathe the layers of leather that the Plastic Burner wear - as if their skin 
were melted off the bone and poorly healed. The thick black smoke chokes out 
much of the light, but it is still possible to see through for anyone 
determined enough to stay a while.

The Firebreather's Pit; the Red Stompers~
   As large as this warehouse is, it still does not quite seem 
large enough to hold everyone that wishes to be within it. A 
massive crowd of people is constantly on the move, clambering for 
their turn to give the workers their organic goods. These 
workers form three parties: the first are burly men who take the 
offered materials, the second are the men that stand atop the 
Firebreather, mashing the materials down with thick legs and 
large feet, and the last party are the men that pass out the 
recycled portions, most of whom have one or no legs. The first 
two parties occasionally switch out, the stompers getting a 
much-needed break every now and then. Bodies, carcasses, and 
other assorted organic materials constantly run through this 
simple production line, offering the men no rest as the traffic 
of the city flows constantly around them, unending.

running one length of the wall, five urinals running the opposite

shattered mirror sits above that lone sink, offering cracked 
reflections to any that wish it. Oddly enough, all of the 
urinals are fairly intact.

are set thick plastic doors, numbered, and presumably for rent. 
Interspersed between the doors are three-high rows of capsules, 
designed to accommodate those without funds to rent a complete

A Memorabilia-Ridden, Cozy Lounge~
   This rectangular polyprop room is decked in all kinds of 
memorabilia and trophies. The head trophies of all kinds of 
wildlife line the northern wall, but makes a clearing for the 
centerpiece: a brown polyprop board with gold engraving, with a 
long ivory-colored claw affixed to it. The lettering reads on 
the gold engraving: "To "Wild Cat" Mont, Lucy-Wrangler". 
Scattered about with no real organization, the furniture is 
assembled as though a drunkard did it - and likely was the case. 
The flooring is entirely dingy red carpet, and the walls are like 
streaks of a rainbow, all graffiti and obscene phrases in spray

A Dirty-Yellow Stairwell~
   This is a circular stairwell that spirals its way up to an 
upper level. The stairs are rickety and creak and groan when 
stepped upon, but appear to be sturdy. The polyprop that 
comprises this stairwell is a dirty yellow - probably once white.

   This hallway is made out of yellow polyprop - or perhaps it 
was once white - and clearly has the look of bare minimum 
cleaning to it. Every now and then a spray-painted Vultures' 
symbol is visible on the ceiling or wall - the trademark 
blood-dripping beak. The carpet underfoot is a dingy red, 
running down the length of the hallway. 
   At this particular juncture, the hallway extends in all 
cardinal directions, the south blocked by a black polyprop door.

A Disheveled Barracks~
   These dirty-yellow barracks are the epitome of an apathy to 
orderliness. Any neatly arranged bunk beds are an exception to 
the norm. It is quite curious then, that the walls and floors 
are quite clean, a fact probably owed to cleaning-bots. However, 
where personal effects are concerned, the contrast is night and 
day. Random pictures of nude women, robot-designs, radio-show 
ads dot the walls. The dingy red carpet underfoot is crunchy, 
doubtlessly with random junk.

A Domed Entryway~
   Roughened walls of dark-grey concrete line this large, domed 
entryway, the ceiling stretching high overhead. Several dark 
sconces line the cold walls, holding long-dead battery-operated 
lanterns, most having been broken, their parts scavenged. Uneven 
stonework lines the floor, a dirty footpath leading from north to 
south through the center of the room. Off to each side of the 
dirty path the stone appears pristine, as though no one has trod 
upon it since its installation. Doors lead both north and south

three or four people at a time to linger in the area. To the

A Gold-Painted, Gaudy Lounge~
   Whoever decorated this room has a penchant for the Terran 
Victorian style. A mock-fireplace stands against one wall, while 
the gold-framed portrait of a wiry, raven-black-haired man hangs 
above it. His ever-smug face is captured beautifully, as he 
stands casually in a long white-and-yellow long coat, leaning 
against a nondescript white wall. More portraits hang on each of 
the walls, some quite random in content. Many of them, however, 
depict a glowing city built on a lone hill, overlooking a sea. 
The floor mimics Terran marble, in reality white polyprop, but 
painted in such a way as to give such an impression.

walls grimy from countless hands that have been dragged along 
their surface. The floor is painted a dark gray, the walls a 
boring lime and the ceiling, which hosts a pair of flickering 
incandescent bulbs has been painted an out-of-place pink. Doors 
lead to the east and west along this length of hallway and above 
a sturdy cable tray holds many cables just below some ventilation 
ductwork.

Cavernous Drill Hall~
   This cavernous hall is nearly twenty paces long and fifteen 
paces deep and devoid of anything that may be considered homey. 
The walls are stark and smooth, painted a putrid pea-green, with 
the exception of a single huge mural, painted in a bright white 
that stands out sharply, along the eastern wall, that of a huge 
circle with a lower-case 'a' within, forming a '@'. The floor 
and ceiling, which hangs high overhead have been painted a dull 
brown.

   Of simplistic design, this squared room is open and spacious 
with its eastern and southern walls covered in hooks and panels 
to allow access to the well-stocked inventory of tools. 
Workbenches adorn the walls below the tool panels, their plastic 
surfaces well-worn yet cleaned and tended. The floor is a drab 
gray with a painted symbol of a circle and lowercase 'a' directly 
in the center in bright yellow. Overhead a maze of ductwork 
spider-webs in all directions, along with electrical conduit and 
cable trays, which are overloaded with bright blue coils of wire.

panelled with angled and spaced plastic squares of multiple hues, 
arranged in random sequence. The floor has been painted black to 
add to the relaxing atmosphere and the ceiling is a majestic navy 
blue, nearly black. Flecked into the ceiling are bits of 
twinkling matter that flash when seen in just the right light, 
simulating a starry blanket overhead. Upon the floor, just 
before the east exit, a symbol has been painted in clean white 
and seems to have a path beaten around it on both sides where 
others have avoided stepping on it.

grungy and unkempt. The ceiling is darkened with smoke and the 
walls with stains from blood, urine, and other less identifiable 
sources. A platform made of thick plastic slabs is bolted into 
the walls, making a loft above. To the west the space expands 
outward and upward, the ceiling over twenty feet up and the 
entire space filled with clanking and groaning pipes and 
equipment.

   A golden carpet lies thick on the floor here, running the full 
length of the room, and apparently cleaned very regularly. The 
walls are polished white polyprop, spread out into a wide room, 
trimmed with golden alloy. The food processor sits against the 
far wall, painted with a stylish W, the red letter taking up a 
majority of the machine's side. Overall, entirely too much care 
has gone into the upkeep of this room.

by a massive food processor which growls constantly, its 
incessent hum vibrates the floor slightly. A sharply-contrasting 
symbol has been painted upon the southern wall in black, that of 
a circle with a a lowercase 'a' emblazoned within, it is 
remeniscent of the '@' symbol.

   A floor of off-white slab plastic is bolted into the concrete 
walls here to make a serviceable loft over the grimy floor below. 
The loft is about ten feet deep and twice that to span from wall 
to wall along its other dimension. The main feature of the loft 
is in the wall to the east, where a thick metal drop-hatch allows 
visibility down onto the street. To the west into the building 
the loft simply ends abruptly, wide pipes and thrumming pistons 
arching up and down in the space beyond.

A Utilitarian Workshop~
   This workshop is decidedly utilitarian, not even colored as

was intended for only one thing: work. All manner of equipment 
and machinery has been arranged against the walls, and it is 
often hot and cramped.

A Cramped Tunnel~
   Made, for the most part, out of thick concrete, this tunnel 
runs down into the moonrock rather sharply. It is wide enough 
for only two people abreast, and seems mostly utilitarian in 
purpose - it is a means to get from point A to point B, and 
nothing more.

   An original, smooth concrete slab still making up the floor, 
the roof and walls of this shanty are rebuilt of sheet-metal and 
chinked with rags and scrap. Dozens of thick pipes rise through 
the floor at the far end of the room and snake off in all 
directions while a round bolt-hatch opens right in the center of 
the room, leading to a chamber below. Around the room are strewn 
random personal effects and odds and ends that work as furniture, 
many years of careless men leaving their mark as they pass

A Small Niche, Below The Platform~
   Thin streams of light filter down from between the thick 
plastic slabs that make up the large platform above, barely 
penetrating the dust-laden darkness below. The concrete walls 
encasing the area are darkened with stains from blood, urine and 
other unidentifiable bodily fluids. Thick metal pipes 
criss-cross overhead, flexible wiring attached to the underside 
of the platform holding them aloft. Several large pieces of 
equipment have been abandoned here; some irreparably damaged, 
others stripped down to their skeletal remains.

tools of all varieties, demonstrating an utter lack of sales 
theme. A chipped and scratched counter made from scrap metal and 
moonrock is erected in front of a closed doorway leading into the 
back of the shop. The walls are decorated with a cover of old 
paper advertisements and brightly colored picture posters from 
years long gone, the ripped pieces made into a sort of artsy 
vintage collage.

A Cozy Backroom~
   A square, folding card table set with three chairs takes up a 
good potion of this small back room. The fourth chair is pushed 
off against a space on one of the walls next to the heating 
furnace, teetering with a broken leg. A single bed made up with 
a thick patchwork blanket takes up most of the remaining space, 
shoved into a corner against the walls. Though small and dimly 
lit, the room is cozy and almost gaudily overdecorated-- three of 
the walls are decorated with the same kind of artsy vintage 
poster and paper collage that is in the front of the store, but 
much of the content and pictures are more lurid and risque, 
bordering on downright obscene in some places. The last wall has 
a chest of dresser drawers and a shelf-case pushed against it, 
and has been painted a rich blood red hue. Small faux flower 
bouquets have been shoved into small cans and jars that serve as 
makeshift vases and stationed on the various surfaces around the 
room. A thick green shag rug is thrown onto the middle of the 
floor and a tall, rusty cage fan is set up in one of the corners 
to help cool the room during the heat of daylight.

some loose wiring. Shelves and trunks are provided for 
organizing goods to store or sell. Some of the most unappealing 
junk items have a rather thick layer of dust on them, and it 
seems they haven't been touched for years. A small and wobbly 
side table provides space for managing and storing any currency 
that comes in.

A Basement Collection~
   This little carved out basement room is a menagerie of 
numerous antique treasures, all of them lovingly arranged and 
displayed on shelving and surfaces. Most of the items are 
trinkets, tiny toys, or pieces branded with old pop culture 
references, worthless by currency standards but priceless to the 
eye of a collector. Old and rusted license plates or road signs 
cover any bared wall space and are propped to display along the 
tops of the shelves. An old battered blue armchair alongside a 
tiny folding tray table is situated in the center of the room, a 
seat for the admiring viewer. Though coated with a fine layer of 
dust, some of the glass items still catch the light at certain 
angles, the eye-catching glimmers serving as insistent reminders 
of a time long lost.

The walls are painted with thick white and black stripes, a 
pattern that flows across the floor in black and white linoleom.

privacy. A counter and cupboards line the opposite wall, serving 
as a storage and cooking area. The walls in this room are a 
soothing taupe color, the tiles on the floor set to match. A few 
lightbulbs dangle from the cieling, with brightly colored plastic 
shades in red and orange.

from the center of the cold floor, however, and shoved off into 
the corners. Arrayed around the room are perhaps, at the most, 
half a dozen rickety metal bunks that are more or less kept in 
some state of cleanliness relative to Grungetown.

   By the standards of the surrounding buildings, this room is 
fairly large. It has old metal pieces in the floor, and a pit 
cut out towards the center area. Everything is covered in a 
layer of old grime, perhaps oil, dust, or other substances. 
Along the walls are organized some metal shelves, leaving most of 
the space open. One sturdy door leads off to a smaller room, 
while a curtained off portion can be pushed aside to open into a 
dingy bunkroom. Frequently, there are bits of metal on the 
floor, making walking about in bare feet treacherous.

A Chaotically-Decorated Clinic~
   Decorated somewhere between primitive domicile and medical 
clinic, this long room is floored with cleanly-swept concrete 
covered in a motley assortment of braided rugs and a few cots and 
bedrolls. Tubing runs across the ceiling and walls, from which 
strange fetishes and mobiles crafted of bits of plastic, bone and 
organic debris hang. Modern and primitive are joined almost 
forcibly together. A stainless steel sink, simple and sterile in 
construction, has had etchings of raindrops and a fierce, almost 
abstract figure holding wheat scratched onto it. The curving 
walls have been daubed with paint, picking out equally strange 
and vivid creations of dancing figures, some almost frenetic and 
morbid in design, others more serene. 
   Hung here and there to afford some screening, are long swathes 
of cheap red cloth. In the center of the room, radiating heat, 
is a bulbous stove. Despite the hectic painting and decoration, 
signs of modern medical treatment can be glimpsed in a couple of 
tin and synthwood racks, and an ancient-looking sterilization 
unit that sits on the stove. 
   Ever vigilant, a few Barker Dog-marked narrow-eyed guards keep 
a constant eye on the proceedings here.

The Back Room of a Lodge~
   The frenetic paintings of the clinic have given away to more 
serene decorations done in a monochromatic, and somewhat sooty 
print in simple, almost geometric designs, that form a band 
around the curved chamber. The thick concrete wall and door, 
beside which rests another scanner, help to muffle the sounds of 
the other room to muted levels. Another stove sits in the middle 
of this room, helping to keep the heat to comfortable levels and 
a couple of large shelves and a few boxes make clear that this 
room's secondary function is mainly for storage. The primary 
purpose is also clear. Along a raised and softly-padded section 
of concrete are hung curtains of vivid cloth, creating shade and 
enough quasi-private space for a few bedrolls.

The Golden Touch~
   The main room of the shop is relatively wide and spacious, 
brightly-lit and clean. The champagne-colored, concrete walls 
bears a wide array of patterns and illustrations tacked to it, 
detailing various clothing for sale, the ebon carpeting worn down 
from years of traffic. A pair of doors flank either side of the 
shop, one leading to the outside, the other leading deeper into 
the store. Several long, metallic black shelves have been 
arranged into neat rows in the centre of the store, hosting 
various loose goods for people to see. A makeshift display case, 
fashioned from a pair of intact car windshields and a 
gold-painted metal frame, holds more precious items within it. A 
reinforced door leads to the backroom on the western wall, just 
behind the display case.

   A myriad of colors cover the cracked, concrete wall and floors 
in artistic disarray, dyes and paints stains nearly ever inch of 
dull grey concrete. Makeshift mannequins and easels lie 
scattered haphazardly about the room, their twisted, melted 
polyprop forms casting eerie shadowy projections in the dimly-lit 
room. The room is rather bare, and spacious, save for the most 
essential of equipment. A series of shelves lends organization 
to potential clutter. A colorful, patchwork cloth hangs across 
the eastern exit, while west and south leader deeper into the 
shack's depths, the latter being barred by a reinforced door.

A Simple, Cluttered Storeroom~
   Small and utilitarian, this storeroom does little more than 
house the store inventory. Assorted metal boxes containing 
various goods and wares line several long shelves along the 
southern wall. A large magnon table sits in the center of the 
room, a lockbox atop it holding chips between transactions. The 
stone floor is covered in a fine layer of dust, a stained with 
paint. A narrow, reinforced door leads north back to the 
workroom.

A Graffiti-Covered Living Quarters~
   Nearly ever inch of surface area within this room has been 
sacrificed as a makeshift canvas for elaborate graffiti tagging. 
Many styles of graffiti cover the room, ranging from realistic 
murals to trippy surrealistic expressionism, most painstakingly 
detailed. A simple, cluttered desk sits beside a set of metal 
shelves, while a small set of crimson-dyed couches are arranged 
around a makeshift kitchen.

Grimy Change Room~
   This grimy change room has a number of nicked and worn 
polyprop benches, lockers, and tables, suited for allowing 
gladiators to change and dress back in to their normal clothes. 
Cut out from the stony underbelly of Grungetown, a few flickering 
electric lights provide just enough visibility to get dressed.

A Derelict Shop~
   Concrete walls square-out this room, once painted a gaudy 
yellow, now chipped and faded. Stains mar every surface with a 
smeared, bloody handprint faded to brown on the north wall. A 
rickety counter has been broken, half-standing near some scraps 
that were once shelves. Waste and detritus has collected in all 
corners of the space and piled across the floor.

Andelle's General Store and Tech Repair~
   The storefront of Andelle's General Store is relatively wide 
and spacious, brightly-lit and clean. The four moonstone walls 
encasing the room have been painted a dark shade of red, each 
decorated sparingly with petrified heads of various wild life and 
framed blueprints of robots and other forms of technology. In 
the center of the store are several long, black magnon shelves, 
each housing a wide variety of electronics and general goods. 
The more expensive items are locked up in a display case set in a 
wide metal counter that runs the length of the western wall, just 
in front of a reinforced metal door leading deeper into the shop.

shade of magenta, a stark contrast to the thick black carpeting 
covering the majority of a floor, the old oil stains barely 
discernible. A working station and drafting table dominates the 
center of the room, each kept surprisingly clean compared to the 
cluttered shelves donned on the northern wall, each filled to the 
brim with a wide variety of supplies, tools and mechanical 
replacement parts. A tarped entrance set in the eastern wall 
leads back to the shop's main room, while a pair of reinforced 
doors in the southern and western walls lead deeper into the 
shop.

storeroom instills a sense of claustrophobia. Assorted metal 
boxes containing half-repaired robots and tools line several long 
shelves on the northern wall. A large magnon table sits in the 
center of the room, surrounded by numerous stacks of boxes. The 
stone floor is covered with a fine layer of dust, and stained 
with oil, the walls surprisingly clean. A narrow door is to the 
south, leading back into the workroom.

   Lilac colored walls framed by white with swirled detailing 
makes up the framework for these spacious living quarters, the 
scent of a sweetly smelling perfume lingering in the air. The 
furniture is all the same, dark-tinted chrion and magnon. A 
large bed dominates the southern wall, two heavy chests with 
drawers filled to the brim with colorful, feminine apparel 
flanking it. A make-shift kitchen dominates the southern portion 
of the room, consisting of nothing but a a small counter and a 
series of shelves housing a few edible items.

ventilation, water and exhaust ways.

   The floor of this shop is well swept revealing dark stains and 
several deep gouges on the hard cement. The walls are rough and 
variated in color as if layers upon layers of posters, glue, 
wallpaper and paint have been peeled and glued over time. There 
is an old warped advert poster of TitonBack hanging on the wall 
behind the counter, along with bits and pieces of taped, glued, 
and pinned yellowed paper with various scratchings. The ceiling 
has dark water stains in one corner by the door.

A Tidy Living Space~
   Neat and ordered, this room has obviously been turned into a 
living area. A rough, but sturdy bed has been placed in one 
corner, made up with clean black sturdy polymesh sheets and a 
burgundy, thick-weaved polymesh comforter. In the opposite 
corner, a sink has been installed, while shelves take up any 
other availablewall space. The walls themselves have been 
cleaned down close to their original soft grey color. Scribbles 
and drawings adorn three walls, mostly odd scratchings of tiny 
windup things, squares piled upon each other to form a hovel, and 
sketches of various critters, creatures, and vehicles. On the 
fourth wall there is a single drawing of Earth made with 
meticulous care. On the floor is a worn, red carpet, protecting 
bare feet from the hard, cold polycrete beneath.

Interior of a Capsule Pod~
   This tiny, cramped capsule pod is just big enough for one 
person, and perhaps a backpack full of whatever items they could 
scavenge. Colored a grimy, uneven beige, the bottom of the 
capsule is a patchy, bug-infested mattress fashioned from some 
lumpy and not very soft polymesh. A single dingy light, set 
behind some tough and translucent polymesh siding, is set in the 
centre of the pod of the capsule. A set of iron rungs also set 
in to the ceiling allow you to pull yourself in and out of the 
capsule as needed, and there are a variety of small and large 
pockets that run up and down the sides of the pod.

A Lobby in the Midst of Reconstruction~
   By Grungetown standards this room would be considered 
cavernous. Wide open and constructed of a blend of steel-grey 
concrete and moonrock inlaid with veins of high grade white 
polyprop that present a marbled effect. The wall behind the 
faux-woodgrain, polyprop reception station is dominated by an 
immense red 'W' set within a circle. The floor is tition-alloy 
and textured in a gridwork pattern bare of any manner of 
covering. Inlaid in the floor's surface is a mirror image of the 
wall design. Construction continues to take place all around, as 
new materials are transported and set into place by groups of 
laborers and specialists, the most evident cause of the 
construction-based clamor which resounds incessantly throughout 
the area.

grainy, off-white building material used to form the ceiling, 
walls and floor. A heavy ironalloy door is set in the southern 
wall, numerous locks and bolts affixed to the inside, while on 
the opposite to the north a hole cut in the box and covered by a 
drab red curtain leads in to a second room. A row of small 
recessed lights are set in the ceiling.

bubbling energy, the Perimeter, and the stark and dusty Outlands 
beyond it. Back from the view, this tiny room is large enough to 
contain a bed and maybe a piece of furniture or two, but 
otherwise the dull polycrete walls seem to loom near. A square 
hole cut in the southern wall and covered by a curtain leads to 
the front room.

The Red Armory~
   The shopfront of this shack is composed of recycled and 
refurbished scrap metal, painstakingly pieced together to form an 
exterior that offers little more than protection from the 
elements. The floor of the shop is barren, boards along the 
outskirts of the place protecting from seepage below the walls. 
Hanging from the middle of the shop is a sign, reading "FUR 
DISPAY PURPASS ONLEE," beneath which a rough picture detailing a 
rifle without the bolt is drawn. Along the western wall is a 
display case which holds an assortment of melee weaponry, all of 
which are bolted to the case by wire. On the opposite eastern 
wall is a shelving unit which displays an assortment of body 
armor, ranging in make and size, all of which is equally secured. 
On the southern side of the storefront is the check-out counter 
and revealed through clear plastic windowing is an assortment of 
small arms and magazines. Behind the counter circling the heavy 
metal doorway is a large shelving unit which displays the larger 
rifles and boxes of ammunition beneath.

crates take up the majority of the space along its walls. At the 
center stands a worktable, outfitted with a series of chairs, 
providing the only sense of comfort within the hectic clutter of 
this space. On the western wall is a doorway, its path kept 
fairly clear from debris and tools. Near the southern wall is a 
trapdoor, which is fairly easy to spot despite the clutter.

which leads to the above trapdoor in the center of the room. 
Polymesh carpeting covers the ground, which is littered from dirt 
crumbling off of the grey stone walls. A series of support beams

La Revolucion Gambling Den~
   A thin haze of tobacco smoke clouds the atmosphere of this 
small gambling den, the scent of sweat and cheap alcohol 
lingering. The walls are a bare grey moonrock, stained black and 
yellow over time from smoke. The floor is covered in what once 
might have been a plush, velvet-like polymesh, though time has 
trampled it down everywhere but in the corners. In many places, 
the fabric has been worn down to the moon-rock floor beneath. 
Old tables have been scattered over the room, the once vibrant 
green polymesh tops to them now stained a spattered brown. 
Barstools seem to be the seating of choice, many of them having 
their legs cut down sot that their occupants might be level with 
the table, though the job has often been done unevenly, some 
higher than others, with most unstable.

use of the plastic fibre ladder which has been securely fastened 
to one of the more solid looking walls here, though there are 
other gaps which open up in the rubble in the dark. This place, 
seemingly forgotten, is dangerously close to collapse but seems, 
in its angles, to remain upright for the time being. The floor

quiet in this grey concrete basement and only the occasional 
dripping can be heard from some forgotten water pipes. Cracked 
and eroding quickly, the walls have been somewhat poorly 
decorated with torn and greyed posters, mostly depicting 
prominent mutant radio show hosts and band members. The western 
wall holds way to another darker room by way of a very narrow

sides except a small area which leads eastward via a narrow 
corridor. It is damp and cold in here - not particularly 
comforting for most. The walls are cracked for the most part and 
litter and refuse line the walls, shoved there in an attempted 
clearance. Around the room are scattered filthy beds and plastic 
crates, their surfaces usually filled with clutter such as 
clothes, food wrappers or weaponry. A very dim light gives a 
soft white glow over the room - not by any means uncovering the 
entirety of this dark place - and it flickers on and off

The Firebreather's Pit; The Bullet Eaters~
   The metal panels lining the walls have a layer of soot, scrubbed and 
recoated time and again. Dust filters across the rubberized, dark grey floor, 
scuffed from heavy objects and the tread of traffic across it. The interior of 
this large chamber would fit a number of people, even with the mechanical 
monster taking up the majority of the room. A small metal plate is bolted into 
the wall near the western doorway.

A Dank, Dark Cellar~
   A single lightbulb has been hastily wired overhead, the black 
and red wires providing it's source connected to a small, 
corroded battery sitting in the northeastern corner. The walls 
are gray and dirty, smeared, stained and battered with all manner 
of foul and violent substances. Upon the eastern wall is a 
particularly large #9red stain#0, pockmarked with what look to be 
bulletholes. Dust and dirt cover the floor below, bare and 
solid. Despite the small confines of the area, noise seems to be 
absorbed into the walls rather than echoed. On the northern wall 
sits a small, narrow entryway about four feet tall and two feet 
across, reinforced and bolted with several high-tech locks.

A Spartan Sparring Room~
   This room is a deep rectangle, running along side the 
warehouse to the east. A metal rail runs along the open space of 
the warehouse's air, preventing untoward falls. The walls here 
are of concrete painted beige, the floor of textured faux-wood 
plastic, deep brown in color. Racks line the wall with weapons 
of various sorts bolted for display.

A Rubble-Strewn Flashball Field~
   This long, rectangular field stretches along the outer 
sheet-metal wall of the Arena Warehouse to the east, wrapped on 
the north and west sides by chainlink fencing and steel support 
posts which hold #2bright white lights#0 above, shining down to 
illuminate the whole field. The ground is rough heavy gravel, 
composed mostly of charred and collapsed moonrock smashed into 
grape-sized nuggets and layered thick to provide a level ground 
surface. Above the lights and girders above, the area is open to 
the sky, though the bright lights obscure the comforting colors 
of the ion field above Grungetown.

A Set of Alion Bleachers~
   These alion-metal bleachers rise at the north end of the 
field, the Marketplace visible if you look over the back rail. 
In front of you lies a clear view of the entire Flashball field. 
A chainlink fence rises between the field and the spectators for 
their own protection. You can #6WATCH SOUTH#0 to keep an eye on 
the game.

Inside a Large Makeshift Tent~
   Wide enough to accomodate about ten people, the abundance of cots stretched 
across the large tent makes for a cramped and congested environment as is. 
Sheets of heavy duty canvas have been stretched and secured onto thick chrion 
poles to create this makeshift shelter. The heavy stench of sweat from too 
many unwashed bodies crammed into one space only adds to the discomfort. 
Lacking the convenience of electricity and running water, worn pole lights have 
been erected about the shelter, casting flickering shadows when the light is 
dim. The flap to the outside marketplace is pinned open, the occasional 
incoming breezes managing little in the role of airing out the dwelling.

Onboard a Hoverboat~
   The entirity of this smooth-lined hoverboat features hammered sheets of 
manon metal overlaid in a watertight layer of clear polyplastic. Exposed to 
the elements, the deck itself provides about two feet along each of the sides. 
Small rounded handholds are present along the perimeter, interspersed with 
carved notches likely used to steady gunnery during an excursion. Two backless 
benches serve as sparse furnishings up the length of the flat-bottomed vehicle. 
To the fore is a shielded #3console#0, consisting of a refurbished laptop 
programmed with movement commands that connect the complicated array of robotic 
drives. At the rear of the boat, a large anti-gravity drive is set up as a 
method of propolsion, able to be rotated to control the direction of movement.

   Shielded by a translucent layer of black plastic, this electronic computer 
console serves as the directional apparatus in order to manipulate this 
hoverboat craft. The operator of the craft could #6POWER#0 the #6BOAT-ON#0 or 
#6POWER the #6BOAT-OFF#0. Once in operation, they could then program the 
directional course of the craft itself, allowing propulsion to #6STEER NORTH#0, 
#6SOUTH#0, #6EAST#0 and #6WEST#0 directions.
