The Mountains of Eternal Light~
   These twisting, jagged peaks jut this way and that and are 
forever touched by the sun, save, perhaps, where a particularly 
large rock casts a faint shadow. Whatever color the rocks might 
be is hidden by the perpetual light - they gleam white, under any 
condition, and the harsh reflection sends a haze up to obscure 
the purplish sky. The jagged rocks offer very little help in the 
way of travel, and one would have to carefully chose a path if 
they wanted to retain their footing.

Twisting, Eternally Light Mountains~
   Craggy, twisting peaks dominate this landscape, eternally lit 
by sunshine. Gleaming bright off of white rock, the light does 
not even allow places for shadows to hide. Small crevices, 
potholes, and other dangers litter the broken ground, making 
footing dangerous at best. Scattered here and there is the odd 
weed, barely noticeable as green beneath the relentless sunlight. 
Critters likewise scurry about, attempting desperately to find 
cover.

Twisting, Eternally Light Mountains~
   Vicious, blinding light covers this area of twisted mountains, 
almost seeming as physical a presense as the bleached moon rocks 
that make up the ground. Weeds crawl sparsely across the sharp 
rocks of the ground, their shriveled forms fighting for survival 
just like everything else in this harsh domain. The peaks that 
make up the majority of this terrain act as walls, blocking off 
most paths of travel, and making the open paths less than safe.

Twisting, Eternally Light Mountains~
   Whatever color these rocks might be is hidden by the perpetual 
light - they gleam white, under any condition, and the harsh 
reflection sends a haze up to obscure the purplish sky. 
Scattered here and there is the odd weed, barely noticeable as 
green beneath the relentless sunlight. These twisting, jagged 
peaks jut this way and that and are forever touched by the sun, 
save, perhaps, where a particularly large rock casts a faint 
shadow.

Twisting, Eternally Light Mountains~
   Weeds crawl sparsely across the sharp rocks of the ground, 
their shriveled forms fighting for survival just like everything 
else in this harsh domain. Critters likewise scurry about, 
attempting desperately to find cover. The peaks that make up the 
majority of this terrain act as walls, blocking off most paths of 
travel, and making the open paths less than safe.

Twisting, Eternally Light Mountains~
   These jagged rocks offer very little help in the way of 
travel, and one would have to carefully chose a path if they 
wanted to retain their footing. Vicious, blinding light covers 
this area of twisted mountains, almost seeming as physical a 
presense as the bleached moon rocks that make up the ground. 
Gleaming bright off of white rock, the light does not even allow 
places for shadows to hide.

Twisting, Eternally Light Mountains~
   Craggy, twisting peaks dominate this landscape, eternally lit 
by sunshine. Gleaming bright off of white rock, the light does 
not even allow places for shadows to hide. Small crevices, 
potholes, and other dangers litter the broken ground, making 
footing dangerous at best. Scattered here and there is the odd 
weed, barely noticeable as green beneath the relentless sunlight. 
Critters likewise scurry about, attempting desperately to find 
cover.

   A way to the southeast, between jagged peaks, one could just 
make out a faint glint in the mountains.

   A bright light glimmers to the east - bright even by the 
standards of the mountains of eternal light. It seems, from 
here, to be a reflection off of something metallic.

   To the east a massive steel construction can be made out, the 
eternal sunlight glinting off its hull.

Before The Bottom Half of a Massive Ship~
   These jagged rocks offer very little help in the way of 
travel, and one would have to carefully chose a path if they 
wanted to retain their footing. Vicious, blinding light covers 
this area of twisted mountains, almost seeming as physical a 
presense as the bleached moon rocks that make up the ground. 
Gleaming bright off of white rock, the light does not even allow 
places for shadows to hide. 
   To the east rises a massive hunk of steel, roughly cubical in 
shape, though obviously battered around. The infinite sun gleams 
off of the surface of this construction, but, if one were to look 
at just the right angle, they would be able to make out a 
painting on the side of the ship. A massive, two-story-tall 
fiery bird-of-prey has its wings encircled protectively around a 
gray sphere. The painting is chipped and peeling and scraped off 
in some places, but it is intact. 
   A boarding ramp descends from somewhere on the ship above, 
crooked but intact, the steel having carved a furrow into the 
white moon rock.

The Boarding Ramp to a Massive, Wrecked Ship~
   This boarding ramp is nothing small - it is wide enough to 
accomidate five people walking side-by-side, and reaches about 
twenty feet from the ground on the moon to the gargantuan blob of 
metal to the east. The steel is bend slighty, bowed in the 
middle, but is still sturdy enough to walk upon.

The Boarding Ramp to a Massive, Wrecked Ship~
   This boarding ramp is massive, allowing at least five people 
to walk side-by-side with ease. Made of stainless steel, it 
reflects the sunlight harshly, gleaming in the eternal light. It 
appears from the bowels of the ship, sectioned off in places 
where it extended out and away from the massive, twisted, 
gleaming hunk of metal that covers a portion of the mountains. 
The ramp leads a long ways down - at least twenty feet - and has 
no guard rails to speak of. 
   To the east lies the bulkhead of the wrecked ship, thick blast 
doors once in place here now rendered into ribbons of thick 
steel, beaten open and torn to strips from the inside out. 
Beyond the doors lies the darkened ship interior.
