Upon the Surface of Crater Lake~
   This tepid lake is more of a sludge pool than a lake. The 
toxic sludge is viscious and disgusting, smelling horrible and 
composed of rotting bits and pieces of organic and inorganic 
nature. The chemical mixture has combined into a gellatinous 
goop that clings to whatever it touches and burns the eyes, nose, 
and skin of the general populance. 
   To the north stands the Wilmington Dock and Grungetown beyond, 
the populace bustling along with their own business.

Upon the Surface of Crater Lake~
   The choppy waters that make up Crater Lake are absolutely, 
unquestionably toxic. A foul, fetid stench rises from the 
surface, and the water is a half-frozen, thick-gray sludge. Dead 
critters float belly-up in no small quantity, often snatched 
below by unseen scavengers.

Darkening Lake, Nearing the Chasm of Eternal Night~
   The choppy waters that make up Crater Lake are absolutely, 
unquestionably toxic. A foul, fetid stench rises from the 
surface, and the water is a half-frozen, thick-gray sludge. Dead 
critters float belly-up in no small quantity, often snatched 
below by unseen scavengers. 
   Darkness grows as the lake continues southwards and, once it 
hits the southern shore, surrounds entirely. There is no light 
in the Chasm of Eternal Night.
