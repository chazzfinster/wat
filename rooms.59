The Beach~
   The air is salty with seafoam as the waves crash against the shoreline a few 
meters away, scouring the barnacle covered rocks. Beyond is endless ocean, no 
land in sight as the sun hangs in the middle of the sky. To the west stand the 
cliffs, rising thirty meters up into the blue, cloudless sky, rocky pinacles 
standing sentinal over the beach. The shore continues to the south, a narrow 
path having been carved into the surface of the rock. Further in the distance, 
an old wooden ship stands with its back-half buried in the sand, bow standing 
proud and verticle against the sky.

Rocky Shore Continues~
   This rocky path has been carved with intelligent hands from the pale basalt 
that makes up this rocky shore. Tool marks are visible against the stone. A 
few meters to the east, the endless sea batters the shoreline, every few 
minutes a great plume of sea-foam rising to spray anyone walking the path. The 
path continues southward, bordering the massive cliffs to the west, their top 
pinacles worn away by the ever present wind. The sun stands in the middle of 
the sky, baking the rock, while in the distance to the southwest a large wooden 
ship has been half-buried in the sand.

Rocky Shore Before a Small Bridge~
   The endless sun bakes this area of exposed rock, extending out further into 
the surf from the massive cliffs that stand to the northwest. The sea surges 
around this area, occasionally spraying it with a cascade of salty foam. The 
rocky shore stutters here, dipping down into the sea, yet massive wooden pylons 
have been cut and set into holes in the rock, forming the beginnings of a 
bridge that crosses the small inlet. Far to the southwest, a large wooden ship 
stands sentinal over the area, bow pointing straight toward the sky.

A Salt-Stained Wooden Bridge~
   Old planks of palm wood make up this bridge, each board warped and stained 
by the continues spray of salty sea-foam that occasionally coats this area. 
Beneath the boards is a small inlet into the rocky shoar, a tide pool standing 
just to the north. Every few moments, the surf surges in beneath the bridge, 
the sound of roaring water filling the area. The bridge ends just to the west 
and east, where thick pylons of wood have been set into the rocky shore.

Rocky Shore Nearing a Small Bridge~
   The hanging sun seems to continuiously bake this area, the bare basalt rock 
that makes up the shore shimmering in the heat. A nearby #6boulder#0 stands 
close to the path that carves itself into the rock, small notches seeming to 
have been scratched into the surface. Heavy palm-wood pylons have been forced 
into stone cubbies near the eastern shore, on the border of a small inlet that 
brings some of the surf nearer to the cliffs to the northwest. Connected to 
them is a small planked bridge that crosses the inlet, the slow constant wind 
causing the thing to swing slowly.

boulder~
   On the surface of the boulder, there are small etchings, single lines that 
are crossed with a five at regular markings. Should anyone take the time to 
count, there are nearly one hundred and thirty of the small scratches. At the 
top of the boulder, there is a small queen chess piece cleanly stenciled into 
the rock, a smear of dried red covering it.

A Sandy Shoreline~
   Small patches of basalt rock litter the area, but by in large this area is 
made up of a fine white sand, spreading from the cliffs that stand to the north 
to the water that borders the shoreline to the east, the ocean spreading 
endlessly off into the distance. A small path trails to the northeast, a small 
bridge standing over a nearby inlet. To the west, the beach spreads out and 
continues, the wreck of a large wooden ship half buried in the sands some 
distance away, its bow pointed into the air. Overhead, the sun seems to stand 
in the middle of the sky, baking the area.

In the Surf of the Shoreline~
   Waves pound the surf closer the shore, salty spray flying in all directions 
as each moment a new wave rises up and soaks anyone standing nearby or within 
the surf. Larger waves rise up on occasion to crash down closer to the shore, 
white foamy tops churning throughout the area. To the north, there is a sandy 
shore that might provide some respite from the waves, high cliffs perched 
beyond them. Out to see, the waves seem to stretch endlessly.

Sun Baked Shoreline~
   The sun roasts overhead, faint shimmering lines flickering over the 
shoreline that spreads east to west here. Nearby to the north, heavy basalt 
rocks pile atop one another, forming great cliffs that stretch nearly thirty 
meters into the sky, rough pinacles stabbing at the blue sky above. The 
#6sand#0 underfoot here is white and powedery, almost pristine. To the south 
the shore runs down to meet the surf, further beyond the ocean stretching out 
to the horizon. To the southwest, an old wooden ship stands upright, bow 
pointed to the sky.

sand~
   The sand here is fine and uniform, though the observant might note the lack 
of shells. The lack of anything else beyond the small particles of sand, as if 
the beach were simply laid there.

Faded Holographics~
   The sand here is wet from the surf, the occasional wave reaching up and 
pulling at the feet of any who come too close. Further to the south, the surf 
grows harsher, the endless sea beginning and stretching out far into the 
distance. The beach seems to fade in detail as it goes westward, lines of 
programming beginning to be visible as anyone should approach an object. Waves 
disolve into clouds of ones and zeros as they crash, this area clearly 
suffering from some sort of corruption.

Birdun Virtual Reality Loading Station~
   The dark edges of this space seem to shift and change slightly, blurring 
around a hexagonal floor just as black and opaque as the surrounding area. 
Illuminated windows, translucent except for the crisp holotext that labels 
their panes, spin and glow gently with faint and different iridescent shades as 
they hover along the invisible walls of the loading station. Suspended in the 
air at the very center of the hexagon is a #6catalog#0 that describes the 
various programs available.

   Several haughty plateaus tower over the jagged rocks and boulders that 
cradle them, providing a handsome altitude from which to survey the surrounding

around noisily when disturbed. The giant plexiglass #6tower#0 is visible here, 
though there seems to be no direct path towards it between the lunar debris.

   The eastward incline slopes dangerously here, leveling this area the lowest

impossible to see from here. Jagged boulders of varying sizes litter the 
Megadome floor, providing cover and shade. The giant plexiglass #6tower#0 
seems to always remain visible from all corners of the Megadome.

The Birdun VR Megadome Preparation Platform~
   Circular in design, this platform has no walls to speak of. Appearing to be 
suspended in mid-air, the clear plexiglass of the #6platform#0 provides a 
perfect view of the magnificent, technological wonder that is the Megadome 
below. From here, the entirety of the battlefield can be seen: it is quite 
large, perfectly square in design, and the outermost edges of the shape seem to 
blur and shift. Directly below and supporting the platform is a giant tower of 
plexiglass. From up here, it seems the only ways out are either back or down.

platform~
You guess that the platform has been elevated from anywhere between half to a full mile from the ground. The terrain of the Megadome below seems rugged with sharp rocks and uneven hills and plateaus... a most difficult and challenging course. With no other way out or back, it looks as if you have no choice but to #6JUMP OFF#0 the edge of the platform or #6RETURN#0 to the #6DOCK#0.
