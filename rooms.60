Base Room - Underground Chasm~
   This is the base room for the Underground Chasm zone. This 
zone is a dunegeon-like network of mining tunnels dug below the 
base of a natural chasm in the moonscape. The mine was created 
during Utopia by a combination of natural underground features 
and tunnels bored by giant robotic drilling machines. Mechanical 
elements can be found integrated throughout, and some tunnels 
should dead-end at the back-end of a boring robot. These robots 
will be able to be craft/prog activated to allow them to mine 
deeper and unearth/smelt more valuable metal catalyst. Monsters 
and hazards should be present, and likely summoned by the borer's 
vibrations.
