Base Room - No Man's Town~
   This zone is for No-Man's Town. It is based around a 
collapsed sinkhole which became a septic pit. They therefore 
produce ceramics from the clay, and capture methane (for the 
gaslights) and to recombine into plastics.

A Faint Trail Winding Over the Moonscape~
   The dust underfoot shows itself to be thin from wear. 
Parallel lines of hastily placed rocks, cragged and carelessly 
chipped on one side or the other, form the faint outline of a 
marked trail leading westward across the moonscape. Every so 
often signs of recent passers-by are evident, drying puddles of 
urine and burnt filth. Upon the western horizon the tell-tale 
signs of life present themselves - a faint, foul smell casting 
itself in stark contrast with the bare outland air, the distant 
sounds of activity carried aloft by the winds.

The Outskirts of a Foul-Smelling Settlement~
   A thin fence of scrap propped up against itself runs along the 
perimeter of a humble settlement, with a small opening allowing 
passage westward where the sounds of activity sound off 
indiscreetly. The smell of human waste emanates from an 
ever-expanding sinkhole set just off to the north, shocking the 
senses to life. Leading into the town and out towards the 
eastern moonscape, a well-worn trail directs would-be travelers 
and traders towards their destinations.

A Marketplace Set Within Ruins~
   Scorching black streaks of a fire blasted past taint the 
exterior of the bombed out, c-shaped buildings which encase a 
large, open square in the center of this settlement. The 
disparity of wealth within is evident, as some buildings have 
been repaired with high-quality materials while others rely on 
little more than plastic tarpaulins of scrap in varying states of 
decay to protect all within from the elements. Upon western edge 
of the square sits the entrance to a squat, dingy tavern 
displaying a sign depicting a kitchen sink. To the north, sits a 
one-story rectangular building, its entrance flanked on either 
side by flags of opulent heraldry depicting a dragons head 
flanked by two naked women.

The Kitchen Sink~
   A bare-dirt floor, stained nonetheless by drinks, vomit and 
nameless other substances speaks to the quality of this fine 
establishment, no doubt made sustainable by a sheer lack of 
options. Haphazardly constructed tables are arranged in no 
particular order throughout, with chairs ranging from tipped over 
buckets to hand-carved wooden chairs of antique and mysterious 
origins. A plastic-molded bar sits dominantly upon the western 
side of the room, its well-polished surface standing in stark 
contrast to its surrounds, a small metal manhole cover sitting 
just behind it and to the right.

A Dank Office~
   A poorly welded rebar ladder leads down the western wall of a 
surprisingly large square room carved out from the barren floor 
of the room above. Plastic faux-wood paneling lines the four 
walls surrounding, pictures of various pinups in both awkward and 
titillating positions adding a bit of tasteful dcor to the room. 
A series of four monitors lines the eastern wall, while a rich 
mahogany desk sits prominently upon a piece of cardboard against 
the northern side of the room.

Sticky's Sleepover Bunkhouse~
   The scent of incense mixes grotesquely with the sickly sweet 
smell of sweat and pleasure. Large humidifiers flank either side 
of the room, filling it with chokingly thick air. A ragged red 
rug runs down the center of the room towards a table at the 
northern end, mysterious stains dotting it's surface. Cots in 
varying states of decay and filth line either side of the room 
while makeshift sculptures of rock and scrap metal depict 
seemingly humanoid figures in various lewd and semi-heroic poses.

The Sinkhole~
   The unmistakable scent of human waste, putrid and rank, lays 
over the surrounding area as a heavy blanket smothering the 
senses. A sinkhole lays central within this area, rock and dust 
crumbling within and mixing with a blackish brown mud-like 
substance, occasional gurgles of noxious gas pushing up from 
within its center.

Sliding into a Gurgling Mass of Feces and Waste~
   Black-brownish waste and dirt sucks you into the earth below. 
The smell is overwhelming, the scent of pure death, waste and 
foulness growing ever-stronger with each passing moment as you 
plunge deeper...deeper...deeper.

In the Deepest Depths of the Sinkhole~
   Noxious gases intermingle with the suffocating waste which 
surrounds you. Objects, waste, and the rooting corpses of those 
gone before you make brief, hazy appearances in the muck. And 
there is darkness.
