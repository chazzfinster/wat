Base Room - Carthage, the Other Lake Town~
   This is the base room for Carthage, the other town on the lake. Carthage 
provides competition for lake water resources with Grungetown. It also has a 
thriving industrial/blue-collar economy which takes advantage of their location 
to allow less entropy on their massive equipment. Carthage is special in that 
it lies at the very limit of the gravity generator's reach, so at its limits 
(used by the factories) gravity is sometimes moon-normal instead of 
earth-normal.

A Well-Worn Road~
   The moonscape gradually erodes into a well-worn road of barren 
dirt and dust, the result of several faint side-trails melding 
into one leading eastward. Rolling hills rise up on either side, 
their plateaus falling and rising again, rocks and debris strewn 
across their surfaces. The occasional bit of loose trash rolls 
by, betraying the passing of people either recent or long ago. 
Upon the eastern horizon the faint outline of a humble settlement 
can be seen alongside the shoreline of a great lake.

Approaching a Humble Settlement Alongside a Lake~
   A lake of sludge and slime creeps alongside the road here, small ripples 
tickling the surface every so often from movement unseen. To the east, modest 
walls of rock, dirt and debris rise up before you, the road gradually widening 
as it nears massive gates of metal guided in place by a system of pulleys 
connected to wires above. The gates themselves are open, swinging freely and 
no guards appear to be in sight. Faded signs depicting drawings of people 
shooting people are circled and crossed out in red paint. Still standing 
smokestacks are barely perceptible over the edge of the great wall, no signs of 
continued production rising from them. Tendrils of fog seem to wisp from what 
appears to be an abandoned city.

A Silent Entry To A Ruined Town~
   Cracked stones and pitted ground lie underfoot as one walks into this 
wrecked market square, the area littered with gruesomely-mangled corpses that 
lay in various positions, some of their faces twisted in the horror of death, 
wide eyes staring vacantly forward at the stones. The buildings around are all 
intact and standing, rather creatively built and composed of rocks and mud, 
none quite like the other, though most are gray shadows against the murky air 
of the area. No smoke rises from any chimney, and the entire area is cast in a 
layer of stifling fog, preventing proper sight beyond at best a few feet and 
muffling any sound. Over time spent in the square, it becomes quickly evident 
that it is eerily, completely silent, and the rank stench of decomposing bodies 
hangs in the air.

The New World Tavern~
   Faux memorabilia of all things seaworthy line the walls of 
this tavern, from three-masted ships constructed of cans to cheap 
knock-offs of treasure maps tacked upon the walls. Faux-wood 
paneling lines the walls, giving of an aura of a time long past 
as hazy yellow-tinted lights flicker intermittently above. A 
worn-down bar sits at the northern side of the room, shelves of 
bottles pegged behind it. A sign depicting a bed is bolted into 
the wall next to a set of spiraling stairs leading upwards.

Deeper Into A Silent Town~
   The path meanders further into the shadow of a town, leading for a long 
while through lines of buildings, many of them with the door and windows 
boarded up and nailed shut. On many of the boards coating the walls are bloody 
handprints, and there are smears of #1blood#0 all over everything, from the 
ground to the stalls that lie toppled and broken. After a long walk down the 
road, one comes to a square surrounded by three large buildings. To the north 
lies a squat but extended building with a faded red cross sign haphazardly laid 
in front of it. The sign looks to have been splashed with red paint, and to 
have been placed there fairly recently. To the east is a large factory complex 
with smokestacks that emit no smoke sticking out from the top. The method of 
entry is a very tall garage door that opens via a switch next to it. To the 
south is an apartment building with an upper floor that looks to have caved in 
on itself, the supports making up the structure blackened and scorched.

Fenced-In Rubble~
   A chain-link fence surrounds a wide area of rubble covering a 
hillside just within the settlements perimeter wall., an old sign 
hanging loosely from its links depicting a cart carrying green 
rocks. Near the bottle of the hill can be seen the crushed 
remnants of a rail-tracks leading into the innards of the hill, 
though no entrance is apparent.

An Entryway Marked By Violence~
   The entryway of what looks to have been a makeshift infirmary is here, 
completely wrecked and destroyed. Across the room and all along the floor are 
clear signs of violence; blood, gore, and a stray body here and there lining 
the way north. Some tables still stand, having been bolted to the wall or 
floor, and bodies hunch over them, seeming to have been disembowelled by some 
force since death. There is a rank stench of rotten cabbage and the metallic 
whiff of blood in the air, though such are barely perceptible against the 
horrific stench of rotting bodies. To the observant, along the floor from the 
doorway further inside are many drawn-out trails of dried, spattered blood, as 
though something was dragged along deeper into the darkness.

A Horrifically-Mangled Containment Area~
   This area is a horrifying scene of death and decay. Piles of corpses line 
the walls and floor, mindlessly heaped on top of eachother like ragdolls, no 
attention given to their position by whatever brought them here. Many of the 
bodies are only half-intact, with pieces of them simply torn off and nowhere to 
be found, and quite often the bodies have gaping holes where their stomach 
should be, or a missing head. The room looks to have formerly been a sort of 
containment area; a quarantine of sorts. Many cots line the sides of the room, 
though they are all in disarray and many have holes punched through them. The 
stench is horrifically bad and the air is hard to breathe here. #1Blood#0 
lines every surface, coats every fabric and seeps into every crack, the silence 
looming the heaviest here in all of the town.

Lobby Underneath Partially-Collapsed Ceiling~
   This area is dark and stifling, soot and dust hanging in the air, although 
it seems to have been abandoned fairly recently by the look of things. Most 
noticeably, the entire ceiling above one's head has caved in and fallen down, 
so walking through is a bit of a chore, especially for anyone taller than 
average. The upper floors look to have been ravaged by fire, and pieces of 
burnt, blackened fabric coat the ground and furnishings laying about.

An Abandoned Robotics Bay~
   This is a large robotics repair bay, looking to have been used as a storage 
and maintenance station for robots of varying sizes, many of them massive. 
There are many cranes and sections of scaffolding up around rusted, forgotten 
bots, and they are curiously lacking in supports, as though nature itself were 
helping the small arms to hold up the great weight of whatever they might bear. 
The place looks completely abandoned, as though everyone inside simply left and 
never came back, and the beginnings of dust have started to coat everything 
inside.

A Scorched and Wrecked Sitting Room~
   Further into the building, the air becomes a bit hard to breathe, soot 
choking the lungs rather soon after spending any time here. The area's 
furnishings have been toppled and turned over, and in one part of the room lies 
a blackened and burned barrel. If one were to examine the label closely on the 
container, one might notice the words 'COOKING OIL' visible, and with further 
investigation, one might speculate that it was the cause of the fire in the 
area.

A Long Manufacturing Chamber~
   This chamber looks to have been used for long lines of people to manufacture 
electronics and other items of technological significance, and countless parts 
lie all over the room, underneath the bolted metal tables and strewn over the 
floor. It is fairly nondescript at first, though if one were to examine a 
fallen section of wall in the corner closely, they might notice that underneath 
the pile of resulting rubble is an arm, which sticks out a bit, and the hand 
looks to be grasping at the floor, as if to pull itself out from under the 
wreckage.

The Burnt Husk of a Laboratory~
   Heavy plastic walls show irreparable signs of damage. Whatever polymesh 
covering once hung upon it having long ago been scorched off with only 
blackened scraps clinging to the surface. Once likely a laboratory, broken 
vials and equipment is smashed underfoot, blackened furnishings threatening to 
topple over and the ceiling itself sagging along one side. The chrion 
staircase appears to be relatively intact, providing the only access to and 
from this chamber.
