Base Room - Mandira~
   This zone is for Mandira, the Buddhist/Hindu monestary town up 
the dangerous mountain paths to the Northeast of Grungetown. 
They are in an old chem lab on the mountainside and produce the 
grown gemstones.

Outside the Ruined Gates of Mandira~
   A towering concrete gatehouse stands here, twin towers anchored to the rock 
on either side of this mountainous entryway. The buildings themselves appear 
abandoned, the high watchtower windows dried with a frame of blood that has 
seeped down the exterior. The rooftops of a desolate town can be seen far 
beyond, the distance too great to make out any details. The forged iron-alloy 
gates have been severely battered, the original artistic designs crushed and 
warped. A gaping hole has been forced between the heavy gates, presenting an 
obvious defensive weakness even when closed.

Inside a Ruined Gate~
   The concrete, bunkered gatehouse still stands erect, though the iron-alloy 
gates have been hopelessly warped inwards as if something forcibly rammed them 
repeatedly from the outside. Embedded amongst the mountain rocks, the narrow 
staircases climbing the two watchtowers are slick with #1trails of blood#0, 
like a macabre red carpet. An unsettling silence has settled over the dusty 
trail, ruts still deeply etched within the mud where caravaners once brought 
their heavy loads up the slope. A mixture of pitched and flat rooftops can be 
seen at the top of the wide, winding road, though they are too far away to make 
out any details.

An Upsloping Mountain Road~
   Wide and machine-graded with repeating grooves along the ground, this road 
was cut ages ago deep into the solid stone of the mountain and was once 
intended to give good traction for vehicles trying to reach the plateau above. 
As it stands, squat provisional barricades have been made with heavy bags of 
moonscape soil, staggered along the winding trail with gunmounts to provide 
cover. There are no visible guards at these fortifications, a few choice 
splatters of dried blood presenting sign of a struggle. Some of the thick 
polymesh bags have been punctured with bulletholes or slashed open, the loose 
dirt swirling like a low haze whenever the wind passes. Just to the west, the 
lip of the plateau is host to a small city of polyconcrete buildings. 
Following the path eastwards leads down to the bunkered gatehouse, the 
destroyed gate visible from this point on the slope.

A Stone-Paved Courtyard~
   The mountain slope drops steeply to the south, the breathtaking view of the 
moonplains far below a grating contrast to the forsaken remains of this 
community. A singular glimpse of this expansive courtyard and the concrete 
buildings that rise up beyond it would give the appearance of the whole town 
having been abandoned, or worse. Any visible doors seem to have been beaten 
down or splintered. The hard-packed ground is still paved with decorative 
smooth stones laid into the shape of an eight-pointed star, with crude 
fortifications of heavy soil-filled bags blocking most of the eastwards road. 
The extensive #3ornamental plant display#0 probably once stood as this town's 
focal point, but the signs of its long neglect are readily apparent. There is 
a daunting amount of dried blood splattered across the whole of this area, 
spread in numerous drag marks and gory pools.

display~
   This ornamental plant display was originally landscaped with extreme care. 
The low hedges that formed a perimeter around the slender-trunked tree in the 
center have already begun to wither to gnarled, yellowed states, telltale bits 
of torn clothing stuck within. The delicate branches of the tree itself are 
mostly barren, save for a tenacious few leaves in their last stages of dying. 
The brittle leaves which have fallen off are clustered beneath it, matted 
together upon the blood-drenched soil.

A Bullet-Riddled Tavern~
   The painted image of a lotus along the back wall is the only reminder of 
what this desolate establishment once was, the white petals marred by a smeared 
bloody handprint. Many of the long florescent lights have half-ripped from the 
ceiling, some flickering sporatically from the torn wiring. The filmy crimson 
polymesh hangings that covered them quiver in ghostly shreds from the air which 
seeps in through the smashed front door. The faux-wood tables that once may 
have decorated this tavern have been pushed up and stacked in a makeshift 
barricade against the eastern wall, but whatever blasted through here has 
broken most and left them in clear disarray. Screened partitions offer privacy 
no longer, the fabric tattered and damaged. Bullet holes have taken permanent 
chips from most of the concrete walls, cushions have been mutilated by slashes 
and the carpets stained by mud and dried blood. Behind the bar, the shelving 
has been emptied, jugs and containers having leaked their contents long ago.

A Mangled Marketplace~
   This roughly square marketplace is a derelict skeleton of whatever trade 
took place here. Battered vendor stalls have been knocked over with their 
brightly colored polymesh displays utterly trampled against the ground. A 
steady mountain breeze swirls dust above the packed earth, the orderly and 
smooth paving stones soiled by countless dark, obscure stains. A squat and 
non-descript complex of grey concrete buildings rises to the west, most of them 
appearing to be nothing more than abandoned ruins. The remains of the center 
courtyard lies to the south. Bloodied drag marks lead northwards to the front 
of a massive temple, the exterior still supported by squat red pillars.

A Ransacked Storefront~
   The low ceiling further confines this cramped and stuffy polyconcrete shop, 
the interior now destroyed by whatever maelstrom ruthlessly ripped through 
here. The only window present looks to have been painstakingly chipped from 
the solid stone structure and far too small for any chance of escape for even a 
small child. The littered floor is irregularly angled from every 
bullet-riddled wall towards the small circular drain at the center of the room. 
#1Grisly amounts of blood#0 has stained the ground in garish streaks, pooling 
into a sticky mess where the malfunctioning grate must be clogged. The 
tattered ends of a braided rope dangles morbidly from the ceiling above a 
claw-gashed counter, #2a gruesome, bloodied legless corpse#0 slumps at an 
unnatural angle below. The eastern saffron-door barely hangs upon its hinges, 
the thin plastic splintered and torn as if a great force broke it down.

corpse~
   This gruesome corpse must have been brutally slaughtered, both legs look to 
have been ripped off with only tattered, stringy bits left in remembrance. 
Vicious claw marks and savage bites have gouged out horrific chunks from the 
body. A blood-stained braided noose still encircles this man's neck, the end 
of the rope torn likely due to the rolls upon rolls of obese bulkiness that 
this human probably carried only with effort. His face is unrecognizeable, not 
much more than shreds of bloodied flesh with the one remaining eyeball vacantly 
fixed upon the ceiling.

Temple Chamber~
   This large, desecrated temple chamber remains not much more than a ruin of 
what it once might have been. The red painted pillars that bordered the west 
side of the center aisle have toppled over, the ceiling having crumbled along 
with it after losing its massive support. A decaying hand juts out from 
beneath some of the heavy polyconcrete blocks which now dominate that side of 
the temple. #1A staggering amount of blood#0 has defiled this room, coating 
the ground in unsightly layers of the sticky bodily fluid. Blood-drenched 
yellow cushions have been ripped to shreds, distorting the organized rows into 
chaos. Two of the three statues which were displayed at the back of the raised 
dais seem to have mostly shattered when they were knocked over, the only 
remaining one ironically of a loosely robed bald man sitting cross legged with 
his large belly protruding, carrying a serene expression despite the claw marks 
within his face.
