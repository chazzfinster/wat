Base Room - Ruin SubZones / Interiors~
   This zone is for sub-zones in the moon ruins as well as the 
building interiors found there. Each ruin subzone should begin 
on its own base-100 mark. So, zones could potentially be at 1, 
100, 200, 300, etc.

A Eeerie Apartment~
   A technology-saavy occupant once lived here with plenty of 
spare time - this room is filled with entertainment consoles, 
gaming systems, and computer equipment amidst the other evidence 
of daily life. Posters of long-forgotten musical bands line the 
walls, now peeling and curling at the edges. This room is eerily 
untouched by the ages. Used dishes still rest in place on the 
tables, no wall fixtures have been damaged or torn off, and even 
the carpet looks like it might have once been vacuumed, though 
now covered in a century of dust.

have never taken place, though, the occupants eventually just

has reclaimed this space, vinelings and plant life sprawling 
across the floor and climbing the walls, their roots infesting 
the goods that may still lie beneath their unfurling leaves. It 
has an unsettling feel to it, clearly implying that human bodies 
once lay here, left forgotten or piled purposefully, and left to 
rot.

however, the room is not thoroughly trashed. Whether scavengers 
or soldiers performing a sweep and clear, everything here has 
been overturned, smashed, dumped, and emptied. The floor is a 
chaotic mess of goods that is difficult to discern the contents 
of, all the items that once composed a civilized life now

A Gutted Hallway~
   Scavengers have already hit this hallway hard - everything of 
value stripped and hauled off long ago. Carpet nails protrude 
near the edges of the walls, left behind when the carpet was torn 
up for its fabric content. Much of the wallpaper has been 
stripped off and holes have been broken into the wallboard 
behind, dangling wires protruding as evidence that even being 
encased within the wall was not a form of safety for what was 
once there. Stains on the ceiling of old wear and dust are the 
only sign that ornate light fixtures once shone down onto this 
space.

   Little can be discerned about the occupant of this apartment, 
as no discerable care was put into decoration. The walls are 
sage-green, the furniture utilitarian. This otherwise peaceful 
room is marred by the evidence of past violence. Hundreds of 
bullet holes pock the walls, concentrated on the surfaces facing 
the front door. The goods within were riddled and exploded as 
well, leaving a mess for those who come after.

A Exploded Apartment~
   A technology-saavy occupant once lived here with plenty of 
spare time - this room is filled with entertainment consoles, 
gaming systems, and computer equipment amidst the other evidence 
of daily life. Posters of long-forgotten musical bands line the 
walls, now peeling and curling at the edges. The floor here is 
splintered and blackened by the blast crater of a 
military-quality grenade or incendiary device, the charred 
evidence of once peaceful lives scattered violently outwards from 
this central point.

A Gutted Hallway~
   Scavengers have already hit this hallway hard - everything of 
value stripped and hauled off long ago. Carpet nails protrude 
near the edges of the walls, left behind when the carpet was torn 
up for its fabric content. Much of the wallpaper has been 
stripped off and holes have been broken into the wallboard 
behind, dangling wires protruding as evidence that even being 
encased within the wall was not a form of safety for what was 
once there. Stains on the ceiling of old wear and dust are the 
only sign that ornate light fixtures once shone down onto this 
space.

   Nothing more than a breezy vertical shaft, this elevator 
passage provides no comfort, or relief, from the empty space 
above or the long fall to below. Magnon handrails are embedded 
into the side wall, slick with dust and unknown dripped fluids, 
making it a tretcherous ascent or descent to above or below.

A Overgrown Apartment~
   This apartment is cramped and utilitarian, clearly shared by 
numerous adults with little personal space. Multiple beds are 
bolted to the walls with plastic cupboards filled with personal 
belongings that were tucked away. The moon ecology has reclaimed 
this space, vinelings and plant life sprawling across the floor 
and climbing the walls, their roots infesting the goods that may 
still lie beneath their unfurling leaves. It has an unsettling 
feel to it, clearly implying that human bodies once lay here, 
left forgotten or piled purposefully, and left to rot.

recognition of its former colors. The carpet is stained and 
bleached to an odd orangish spectrum of hues, ornate wall 
fixtures bolted overhead.

A Bullet-Riddled Hallway~
   This hallway once was rather ornate, floral wallpaper and 
plush carpeting covering all surfaces and ornate light fixtures 
hanging above the heads of those that pass along its way. Now it 
is marred by the evidence of past violence. Hundreds of bullet 
holes pock the walls, leaving a mess for those who come after.

A Quarantined Apartment~
   This apartment is cramped and utilitarian, clearly shared by 
numerous adults with little personal space. Multiple beds are 
bolted to the walls with plastic cupboards filled with personal 
belongings that were tucked away. It appears this room was 
repurposed during the plague into a quarantine center for 
treating those afflicted. Shelves molder with ancient medical 
supplies and beds have been lined up to care for the sick. A 
large red "X" has been painted on all the doors as a warning, the 
room still containing a rank, rotten smell.

A Heaped Apartment~
   The occupant of this unit was clearly obsessed flowers and 
kittens; images from Old-Earth reprinted and plastered to all 
walls, goods, and surfaces. This space has been re-used as a 
dumping ground for the cast-offs of other spaces since it 
fulfilled its original purpose. Torn-out appliances, 
electronics, bedding, clothes, and more are piled in massive 
moldering heaps upon the floor making it more of a climb to move 
about than a walk of any sort.

A Overgrown Apartment~
   A technology-saavy occupant once lived here with plenty of 
spare time - this room is filled with entertainment consoles, 
gaming systems, and computer equipment amidst the other evidence 
of daily life. Posters of long-forgotten musical bands line the 
walls, now peeling and curling at the edges. The moon ecology 
has reclaimed this space, vinelings and plant life sprawling 
across the floor and climbing the walls, their roots infesting 
the goods that may still lie beneath their unfurling leaves. It 
has an unsettling feel to it, clearly implying that human bodies 
once lay here, left forgotten or piled purposefully, and left to 
rot.

an armed bunker meant to withstand forces that the occupants had 
cause to fear. Furnishings and torn wall-board have been stacked 
and wired together to provide crude cover to those hiding here, 
storage areas hollowed out within the gun nests to withstand a 
siege. A battle seems to have never taken place, though, the 
occupants eventually just moving on.

however, the room is not thoroughly trashed. Whether scavengers

been overturned, smashed, dumped, and emptied. The floor is a 
chaotic mess of goods that is difficult to discern the contents 
of, all the items that once composed a civilized life now

   Facing the altar to the east, this area was simple and 
spartan, consisting of multiple rows of fauxwood mahogany pews. 
The pews now lie disheveled, mounds of trash scattered among them 
as all of the cabinets in the room, and likely from other rooms 
as well, have been dumped here.

A Ransacked Devotional Chapel~
   This was once a quiet place of respite for the residents of 
the building. Mahogany fauxwood paneling covers all the walls, 
alcoves embedded with wiring for screens. Directions printed on 
wall panels next to them explain how to use the screens to access 
various religious content from a variety of faiths. A plain 
altar is mounted to the floor at the front of the room, all 
ornamentation crudely torn off, nothing left but a kneeling pad 
before it.

A Grimy Utility Plant~
   Likely never clean nor organized during its heyday, this 
massive area provides the dirty work for the entire building's 
functioning. Electronics equipment lines the walls, wired in to 
industrial-style power grids and water processing and 
purification equipment. Pipes and thick electrical cables cover 
the entire ceiling, hung from overhead brackets.

A Shattered Elevator Car in a Cavernous Mechanical Room~
   The remains of a shattered elevator car are here, splintered 
into wreckage after plummeting from above. Chunks of plastic and 
metal cable have already been stripped and removed, the mess that 
remains providing little but treachery. Magnon handrails are 
embedded into the side wall, slick with dust and unknown dripped 
fluids, making it a tretcherous ascent or descent to the floors 
above.

   Floral print wallpaper peels from the walls, once having made 
this space homey, now only a bit more decrepit. The reminants of 
life lingering in bits, broken on the floor. What once happened 
here could only be described as stomach-churning carnage. There 
is no order or reason to the mess that now lies within, blood and 
ichors smeared and splattered over all surfaces violently as if 
the violently-insane were fingerpainting.

   Floral print wallpaper peels from the walls, once having made

life lingering in bits, broken on the floor. Whatever it once 
was, however, the room is now thoroughly trashed. Like asylum 
patients have had a tantrum, everything here has been overturned, 
smashed, dumped, and emptied. The floor is a chaotic mess of 
goods that is difficult to discern the contents of, all the items 
that once composed a civilized life now mingled.

attempting to enter this room from the southern doorway. The rest of the room 
is utterly trashed, the northern most edge of the ceiling having collapsed some 
years ago to reveal the the heavens. Set in the centre of the room is a fixed 
table, the padding having been stripped away long ago, the nylon restrains 
remaining for hands and feet.

those hiding here, storage areas hollowed out within the gun 
nests to withstand a siege. A battle seems to have never taken 
place, though, the occupants eventually just moving on.

ecology has reclaimed this space, vinelings and plant life 
sprawling across the floor and climbing the walls, their roots

leaves. It has an unsettling feel to it, clearly implying that 
human bodies once lay here, left forgotten or piled purposefully, 
and left to rot.

a neutral color, now perhaps closer to toupe. It is eerie and 
empty, completely exposed.

A Bunkered Operating Room~
   White walls and bright stainless steel lights impose upon this 
space, a stainless steel table still bolted to the center of the 
floor. Rolling carts, cabinets, and counters surround the walls, 
plenty of room for work. The odd piece of electronic equipment 
still blinks, error codes and malfunctions. This room was 
repurposed into an armed bunker meant to withstand forces that 
the occupants had cause to fear. Furnishings and torn wall-board 
have been stacked and wired together to provide crude cover to 
those hiding here, storage areas hollowed out within the gun 
nests to withstand a siege. It appears their worst fears were 
realized as well - bullet holes mar all surfaces of this space 
and dried brown bloodstains pool behind the barricades, smears on 
the floor where bodies were long ago dragged and none cared to 
clean afterward, the occupants all disposed of.

A Bullet-Riddled Operating Room~
   White walls and bright stainless steel lights impose upon this 
space, a stainless steel table still bolted to the center of the 
floor. Rolling carts, cabinets, and counters surround the walls, 
plenty of room for work. The odd piece of electronic equipment 
still blinks, error codes and malfunctions. This otherwise 
peaceful room is marred by the evidence of past violence. 
Hundreds of bullet holes pock the walls, concentrated on the 
surfaces facing the front door. The goods within were riddled 
and exploded as well, leaving a mess for those who come after.

A Heaped Medical Lab~
   Sterile and utilitarian, this workspace is filled with large, 
immobile equipment such as centrifuges, cabinets, and processors. 
This space has been re-used as a dumping ground for the cast-offs 
of other spaces since it fulfilled its original purpose. 
Torn-out appliances, electronics, bedding, clothes, and more are 
piled in massive moldering heaps upon the floor making it more of 
a climb to move about than a walk of any sort.

   This hallway once was pristine and white, with grey polished 
stone floors, bright light-fixtures mounted overhead. What once

carnage. There is no order or reason to the mess that now lies 
within, blood and ichors smeared and splattered over all surfaces 
violently.

a neutral color, now perhaps closer to toupe. It is eerie and 
empty, completely exposed.

A Gutted Hallway~
   Scavengers have already hit this hallway hard - everything of 
value stripped and hauled off long ago. Holes pock the walls 
where metal bumper-rails have been ripped off. Gaping holes have 
been knocked in, looking like sores on festering skin, the 
electronic equipment that once was embedded there now hauled 
away. Polished stone floors remain, scratched and scarred by the 
dragging of heavy objects, the walls some shade of off-white.

   This is the center of a utility workshop, spacious, with open 
steel-beam rafters arching overhead. Large pieces of equipment 
rest in marked-out squares on the floor, pieces stripped from 
them over time. Cabinets line the walls, still stuffed with 
various goods, this space the mechanical repair shop for the 
equipment of the hospital. Wide isleways lead the the spaces at 
either ends. A massive computer terminal and laser welders, 
broken and stripped, takes up the center of the area. This room 
was repurposed into an armed bunker meant to withstand forces 
that the occupants had cause to fear. Furnishings and torn 
wall-board have been stacked and wired together to provide crude 
cover to those hiding here, storage areas hollowed out within the 
gun nests to withstand a siege. A battle seems to have never 
taken place, though, the occupants eventually just moving on.

   Floral print wallpaper peels from the walls, once having made 
this space homey, now only a bit more decrepit. The reminants of 
life lingering in bits, broken on the floor. It appears this 
room was repurposed during the plague into a quarantine center 
for treating those afflicted. Plastic sheeting drapes from the 
ceiling, sealed in place with thick tape. Stains on the floor 
show not all was sanitary, though it is difficult to tell what 
bodily fluids may have oozed there so long ago. A large red "X" 
has been painted on all the doors as a warning, the room still 
containing a rank, rotten smell.

spores heavy on the air. What once was a hospital food cart is 
now corroded to the floor and appears the center of the 
bread-like explosion, untended baked goods likely left therein 
ages ago.

was, however, the room is not thoroughly trashed. Whether 
scavengers or soldiers performing a sweep and clear, everything 
here has been overturned, smashed, dumped, and emptied. The 
floor is a chaotic mess of goods that is difficult to discern the 
contents of, all the items that once composed a civilized life 
now mingled.

low-headroom providing a challenge, but making it easy to reach

top of the tunnel, thick and cluttered, passing up through panels 
to the rooms above on either side. Lights are mounted on the 
walls on either side, providing illumination downward for foot 
traffic and upwards for maintenance. The walls and floor here 
are splattered with chunks of gore, disturbingly human. It looks 
like it was torn apart by a feral creature with little concern 
for waste or food, the bits just strewn about.

A Fouled Tunnel~
   Plain, utilitarian concrete walls run both directions here, 
low-headroom providing a challenge, but making it easy to reach 
and repair the wires and pipes. Pipes and wires run along the 
top of the tunnel, thick and cluttered, passing up through panels 
to the rooms above on either side. Lights are mounted on the 
walls on either side, providing illumination downward for foot 
traffic and upwards for maintenance. This space is mounded with 
feces and puddled with urine, both splashed and splattered about 
with little concern.

A Blood-Painted Tunnel~
   Plain, utilitarian concrete walls run both directions here, 
low-headroom providing a challenge, but making it easy to reach 
and repair the wires and pipes. Pipes and wires run along the 
top of the tunnel, thick and cluttered, passing up through panels

walls on either side, providing illumination downward for foot 
traffic and upwards for maintenance. The walls here are smeared 
in layer upon layer of dried blood, now a discordant array of 
browns and russets. It is almost mesmerizingly artistic, as if 
this were an artistic endeavor by an intelligent, perhaps insane, 
mind.

A Gore-Splattered Tunnel~
   Plain, utilitarian concrete walls run both directions here, 
low-headroom providing a challenge, but making it easy to reach 
and repair the wires and pipes. Pipes and wires run along the 
top of the tunnel, thick and cluttered, passing up through panels 
to the rooms above on either side. Lights are mounted on the 
walls on either side, providing illumination downward for foot 
traffic and upwards for maintenance. The walls and floor here 
are splattered with chunks of gore, disturbingly human. It looks 
like it was torn apart by a feral creature with little concern 
for waste or food, the bits just strewn about.

traffic and upwards for maintenance. The walls here are covered 
by an oozy slime of unknown origin, slick to the touch and 
unpleasant with a greenish color.

colder than the tunnel around it, with an eerie feeling that 
makes the hairs stand up on the neck.

A Narrow Crawlspace~
   This crawlspace is only half as tall as the adjacent tunnels, 
the bottom area enclosed with symbols marking it and the 
equipment within. Metal walls enclose the four-foot space, 
rattling and banging with every movement.
