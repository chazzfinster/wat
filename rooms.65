Base Room for Tram Town~
   This zone is for Tram Town, the moon civilization closest to 
New Phoenix. It should have the feel of Tokyo, but trashed and 
post-apocalyptic.

High Perimeter of Tram City ~
   Ahead looms the rising perimeter of Tram City though holes appear along the 
gates now, showing flashes of lower buildings and an ever-present glow of 
still-active fires. Purplish-gray skies sweep above the city, mixing thickly 
with the smoke and filth that rises from the shattered remains. The city 
lights are dead, snuffed out by some horrific tragedy. Hard packed dirt leads 
onward towards the great and crumbling gates. The normal bustle of bodies has 
been quelled, leaving the space oddly and eerily quiet on approach. The air 
seems choked with dust and other toxins, giving each breath a sharp acrid 
taste. However, the smell of smoke adds to this already mired soup of smells, 
cloying in the air. Something heavy seems to have been dragged away from the 
city, if a deep furrow in the hard-packed dirt leading eastward speaks of 
anything. Several tire tracks have recently marred the dirt's surface as well, 
likewise leading eastward.

Within Tram City ~
   Lying below the crumbling gates rising to the east, this section of the city 
hangs thick with smoke and the filth of pollution. Fires burn brightly as the 
city stretches and joins with the once-great market westward. Something seems 
to have crashed through here, killing the hundreds of people, the corpses of 
whom lay strewn about in a thick layer of rotting flesh on the ground. The 
smell is horrific, wafting from the dead, though many of them look to be moved, 
rummaged through, scavenged from. A path has been made through the rubble and 
bodies as something was obviously dragged from the west moving eastward, the 
deep furrow leading out the gates coupled with many layered tire tracks.

The Ruined Market That Was Tram City~
   This grand city lays in shambles, with much of it still ablaze. Smoke hangs 
heavy in the air, combined with the rot of death, chokingly strong. At some 
point electricity has failed in this city, leaving the signs that are a 
trademark to the city dark and dull. The massive three-rail track normally 
found loftily above the market has been crashed into by some sort of horrific 
impact and has fallen, destroying multiple buildings along the north and west. 
An expansive crater remains in the center of the market, shattering the already 
rubble and corpse strewn space. Oddly though, whatever seems to have done the 
bulk of the damage is suspiciously absent. Deep furrows into the polycrete and 
moon-dirt of something being dragged away does lead the way out of the city, 
though, as well as numerous tire tracks.

Club Fourty Two~
   This is a blaring, gaudy discotheque, thick with smoke, 
pounding with painfully loud music, and and flashing with 
multicolored scintillating lights. A catwalk runs along all four 
walls accessible by simple steel ladders, watching from about 
fifteen feet off the ground, red-lit rooms accessible off of it. 
A central dance floor flashes with colors as lights beneath its 
checkered panels flash on and off, plush furniture pushed over in 
each secluded corner.

The Remains of New Phoenix Trust~
   Faux-marble chunks cover the the ground while one pillar crafted of the same 
material slopes liltingly to one side across the thirty-foot vaulted room. 
Looking as though it may crash down at any moment, the roof itself is roughly 
cracked and unsupported, wilting in the center. Above where the tellers should 
stand and have by this point fallen, an emblem of a grand phoenix bears spidery 
cracks, one talon having fallen away entirely to add to the mired rubble 
littering the floor. Bits of plaster drift down from above, mixing with the 
dull smoke from the fires outside and making breathing difficult. Several 
bodies litter the ground. They are either crushed beneath rubble or trampled. 
A deep indent into the floor shows something heavy was dragged from the 
southward vault through this room.

A Wrecked Bank Vault~
   The ceiling has almost completely fallen away, crushed by something large 
that has since been removed. There looks to be drag marks leading northward 
towards the doorway, something heavy enough to make indentations into the 
polycrete. Rubble is piled heavily, covering most of the floor. Polycrete 
dust and smoke hang chokingly thick in the air, reducing visibility to a few 
feet at a time. The overhang of ceiling remaining precariously close to 
crashing down at any given moment.

The Entryway of Cybernetic Futures~
   This spacious entryway was designed to be elegant through understated 
simplicity. Arching high overhead, the great domed ceiling is set with the 
focal point of a starburst-shaped skylight. The faux-marble tiles of the floor 
are striated with golden veins, overlaid with a protective clear glaze and 
polished to a lustrous sheen. Embedded within the northern wall is a large, 
flatpaneled monitor repeating a loop of cybernetic advertisements, success 
stories and information. #5An affable secretary with long, blonde curls#0 sits 
at the curving western reception desk, secured behind double panes of 
bulletproof plexi-glass. A set of reinforced vacuum-sealed doors leads through 
to the clinic beyond, likely only able to be opened by employees, while the 
eastern doorway serves as the main entrance back to the market.

secretary~
   This slender-framed woman must work as a secretary here at Cybernetic 
Futures. She could easily serve as the epitome to the idea of 'Appearances 
mean everything'. Her formal dark-blue skirt and jacket suit set is 
impeccable, matching the clean state of her long, blonde curls and neatly kept 
nails. She has beady, dark brown eyes which seem to continually assess while 
her thin, pink lips are plastered into an ever present smile. She sits with 
rigid posture upon a stiff-backed, chrion-alloy chair, protected by the 
separating barrier of bulletproof glass.

A Brightly-Lit Conference Room~
Not particularly large, but made to appear moreso by the bright lights and clean white walls, this room seems to serve little purpose other than discussion. An imposing titon-steel table has been set in the middle, surrounded on all sides by the sorts of chairs that are just uncomfortable enough to keep one from settling back.
