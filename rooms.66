"The Flame" Radio Station~
   All told, this is a cramped rectangular room even without the 
stacks of radio equipment that form a perimeter around the place. 
The polycrete walls are plastered with random fliers and graffiti 
- many of them depictions of a raging inferno with a grin inside. 
There are several chairs arranged before the main radio platform. 
And, above it, is a white banner with a streaking fireball across 
it and the black letters: "THE FLAME".

A Dingy Lobby~
   This circular polycrete lobby has definitely seen better days. 
The walls, once a dark red, are now crusted and stained with 
indistinguishable marks. In the centre is a half-circle counter, 
beat up and chipped, while to either side are couches. However, 
needless to say, this lobby is quite bare. On the western side 
is a thick door painted with a crude flame, and above it reads a 
sign: "THE FLAME RADIO STATION".

An Inviting Lounge~
   This spacious room holds a dimly lit quality through the 
combination of dark colored walls, and the scant use of lighting. 
A circular, polyprop bar hugs the eastern wall, while the couches 
are arranged invitingly. Plush burgundy carpeting lies 
underfoot, the many stains present slightly obscured by the dark 
shade. The room tapers east and west, the adjacent rooms 
appearing more utilitarian in nature.

A Cramped Barracks~
   Utilitarian and spartan in nature, the drab colors of 
polycrete and unfinished iron-alloy prevail in this large room. 
Several bunk beds outfit the room, coupled with a set of lockers. 
The metal furniture is arranged in such a way that affords an 
open area within the room's center, presumably for activities.

An Equipment-Filled Workshop~
   Larger than other rooms in this facility, this workshop houses 
a wide variety of equipment, while still affording ample space to 
work. Iron-alloy shelves line the walls, while a peg board along 
one wall assists in organizing loose tools. The walls, and floor 
are simple, unpainted polycrete, touches of dried paints, blood, 
and grease providing the only other color. A sturdy, polyprop 
door leads eastwards.

Private Living Quarters~
   Though smaller than most rooms in this facility, the lack of 
numerous furnishings lends it a roomy quality. A set of metal 
shelves lines the eastern wall, while a bed hugs is centered 
against the northern wall, sprawling towards the door. A simple 
carpeting of a midnight-blue color lies underfoot, while the 
walls are painted an uneven coat of a similarly dark blue.

The VIP Lounge~
   Up on this platform stand the finest chairs and tables in the bar. The 
carpeting appears freshly dyed with a bright red hue, accenting the fine velour 
seating. The tables are made of solid polyprop colored black and trimmed with 
shiny gold-painted faux-wood carvings around the rim, matching the golden poles 
where the stage curtains separating the platform from the rest of the lounge 
hang. A chandelier hangs from the center of the ceiling, the primary source of 
light for the rest of the bar and lounge areas. #6The stage curtains are

A Classy Reception~
   The paint on the walls has darkened into a shade of dried blood, almost 
black in the dim lighting of the tall room. The arrangement of small light 
bulbs, hung along a single wire enveloping the room from near the high ceiling, 
create crimson blotches of light on the wall. The lounge is large enough to 
accommodate about a dozen patrons with breathing space to spare. Along the 
northwest section is a fireplace perpendicular to the large painting on the 
western wall of a man with windswept blond hair, blue eyes, and pearly white 
teeth. A rug fashioned from russet lagato skin sits before the painting and 
the fireplace, on top of which lies a smoking table flanked by two roomy sofas 
facing the man and the fire. The flickering flames dance upon the dimly-lit 
bulbs on the chandelier far above. The eastern wall hosts a number of smaller 
paintings of women in various states of nakedness, subtly leading inclined 
patrons towards the double-door curtains to the north.

A Dark Hallway~
   The curtains leading back into the lounge are made of a thick, weighty cloth 
of velvet texture and unknown color. They overlap to form a makeshift doorway, 
blocking much light from the previous room. Tracing the walls are bulbs 
arranged on wires as in the room prior, except painted on with hollows of 
stars. The walls are then made to appear like the night sky, the illusion 
broken only by the occasional passerby and the shuffling of the curtain-door to 
the west. The ceiling has been made lower by a black cloth hung just above the 
wired star-lights, its translucence completing the illusion as the lights on 
the cloth are outlined by the faint reflections of light on the concrete 
ceiling above. Further north down the hallway, you see tables covered with 
black cloth, with a candle-like lighting mechanism on them, completing the 
image of the evening. 
   Just before the main lounge is an entrance to the west with a male and 
female sign. Type "#6ENTER RESTROOM#0" to enter.

The Main Lounge of the Burlesque~
   A host of tables covered with black cloth reaching to the floor and 
surrounded by lush theater chairs make up most of the central lounge. A hole 
has been drilled at the center of each table to hold a flashlight, only the top

The Worker's Hallway to the Kitchen~
   A single bulb lights this narrow hallway as it hangs from the ceiling, 
revealing dull, concrete flooring and walls hastily painted over with red 
paint. Hints of a darker color can be seen upon closer inspection of the 
various blotches near the corners.

The Restrooms~
   The restrooms are split into three - patrons first enter a small holding 
area containing a sink at the center for customers to wash their hands in. 
Ambient lighting here is absent, and the bulbs that hang from the middle of the 
ceiling bathe the scene in a plain, white light. The floor is concrete tiled 
with faux-wood squares up to the lower one third of the wall, the upper 
two-thirds painted the usual crimson red hue of the bar proper. A 
half-body-sized mirror hangs above the sink, flanked by two doors leading into 
separate stalls with toilets. The left door is marked with a plain male 
silhouette vandalized with a penis on its crotch, while the right door is 
marked with a plain female silhouette.

The Worker's Pantry~
   This small room is a part of the kitchen separated by ovens and cabinets. 
The bar workers have converted this small space into a quaint resting room, 
with a small cabinet set by the western wall, a small table and some chairs, as 
well as a couple of mats for stretching legs over. A makeshift wall made up of 
stacked junk has been set up here, covered by the old stage curtains. It has 
just enough space for an endowed person to pass between. It separates this 
space from the performers' quarters to the north.

   The walls are more visible from this section of the lounge, hosting a number 
of paintings highlighting local Grungetown culture. The upper two-thirds of 
the wall are painted a crimson red, with the lower third overlaid with gold 
paint and given a canvas texture. Between them is a line of wood also painted 
a shiny gold. The tables here are cut smaller than in the main lounge, hosting 
only at most four people. The lights in the ceiling here are turned off, this 
section relying on the glow from the northern VIP section and the distant 
western bar for illumination. #6The stage curtains blocking the VIP section

A Bar West of the Main Lounge~

with plain synthetic wood trimmings on the bar proper and on the back cabinet 
housing some bottles and glasses. The bar occupies almost two fifths of the 
western section, facing the main lounge with its bright lights. High chairs 
without backrests and covered with black cloth reaching to the floor are lined 
up before the bar, amidst the usual tables from the main lounge spilling over 
to this section. A closed door without handles flaps open and close freely to 
passerby, a circular glass window on it allowing a peek into the kitchens.

   Solid concrete walls rises to the east and west, providing the anchors for 
the paired gates that face each other both to the north and south. A rickety, 
sheet-metal staircase is set into the southern concrete wall, leading upwards 
to a trapdoor above. The gates stand at least twelve feet high to the south, 
made from crudely-wrought steel. The gates rise as tall as ten feet high, 
barring both north and south, made out reinforced high quality iron alloy. On 
the outer northern gate has been emblazoned in its entirety with a stylish 
#8W#0.

   At at least twelve feet high, one of the crudely-wrought steel gates still 
remains on its hinges, but barely so; it's unlikely it'd keep anything out, 
especially when considered the other gate is knocked flat. Both of them, like 
the polycrete gatehouse, are riddled with damages and holes that have been 
partially patched. What used to be a rickety, sheet-metal staircase is now 
just a heap of rusted, twisted rubble against the wall, leaving the trapdoor 
overhead inaccessible. This part of Grungetown is all but deserted.

intruders. Patches have been put over some of the bullet holes and damages in

   This room is quite spacious with weathered, wooden shelves 
that loom in the far corner of the wall filled with a few 
knick-knacks and a creaky ceiling fan hanging from the center of 
the room. The paint on the walls are faded and chipped, much 
like the rest of the building but the floor is covered in a 
shaggy, dark-brown carpet, its age obvious due to the missing 
patches of fabric here and there. The carpet changes to 
scratched wooden flooring in the corner near the shelves where a

mostly dark. Some are little more than massive heaps of polycrete and steel, 
jagged beams sticking up out of the dust and chunks of building materials. 
Heavy damage has been done to the pavement, cracks gaping underfoot and making 
passage of the unwary even more treacherous. Very faint sounds of life, and 
the occasional call or gunshot, can be heard from the northwest. For the most

Flattened, Former Intersection of Junkyard and Wilmington~
   The entirety of this area has been pounded into submission, either by 
concussive force or fire. Still the archway to the blasted zone of Wilmington 
Park stands, but everything else around it is little more than heaps of burnt 
debris. What buildings remain somewhat erect have a derelict look to them, 
sagging to one side or another, or halfway into a pile of rubble. Trash, dust, 
and ash drift on the air and a brooding quiet hangs over the area in absence of 
people.

Deserted, Destroyed Junkyard Row, South of Wilmington Way~
   Large chunks of pavement have come completely free, riddled with cracks and 
potholes and making the surface of the paved road tumultuous. Everywhere are 
signs of fire and destruction, ash intermixing readily with the grey moondust. 
The destruction of the shoddy dwellings is almost utterly complete; some have 
been completely ripped apart, torn from their foundations and tossed aside. It 
is relatively quiet, except for the sounds of the moon's grey surface, with 
very few - if any - people passing through here.

A Choked, Cratered Intersection on Junkyard Row~
   Here the ground abruptly jerks upwards, wrenched from its almost flat 
position and surrounding a relatively small impact crater in the middle of the 
street. Some of the sidewalks have sunk down into it, pulled out of their 
fractured troughs. Many of the pieces of rubble nearby carry scorch marks and 
melting, a charred scent hanging heavily in the air. Where this was formerly a 
four-way intersection, the roads to the west and east have been choked 
completely with rubble and nearly intact building materials.

Quiet, Desolate Stretch of Junkyard Row~
   Dust drifts through the air almost constantly, slightly obscuring vision in 
this area and getting into eyes. It is easily kicked up by any movement across 
the graveled pavement of the road, and puffs down from nearby ruination on 
either side More often than not it is quiet here, almost as quiet as the wastes 
beyond the walls. The only sounds other than scant human passage are those of 
the wind and wildlife.

straight through the center of Grungetown. Far to the north, the looming, and 
broken wall of the Perimeter is visible, and the wide, previously heavily 
traveled intersection of Main Street and Junkyard Row is much closer to the 
east. What was once a booming, prosperous part of town has been dwindled in 
traffic by and large due to the fire damage incurred.

East of a Path through Wilmington Park~
   Dust and remains of singed trash swirl through the air with every puff of

largely quiet, a rubble-strewn grave where there were once shanties and people. 
An occasional weed or other form of the scraggy lunar flora can be seen, and 
also a few animals as the ecosystem works to reclaim this destroyed area. 
Further south is a badly battered dock, stretching out over the toxic goop of 
Crater Lake.

Burnt Section of Street, West of Wilmington Park~
   Somehow the widely wrought destruction has cleaned this portion of 
Grungetown, much of the trash burnt away to leave the jagged and tumultuous 
clods of lunar dirt in view. Some areas it still lingers, and pieces of metal 
and plastic have been strewn everywhere from destroyed buildings. Further to 
the east, the remnants of Wilmington Park have faired even worse, almost 
completely unrecognizable and utterly destroyed. South, the largely cleared 
portion of street continues into the icy sludge of Crater Lake. 
   A crude barricade has been pulled to the east.

Charred End of Junkyard Row, Just Before Crater Lake~
   Some new growth of weeds and local flora have begun to regrow in this area, 
but not much else has. The streets are desolate and deserted, flanked by 
charred and melted piles of what was once dwellings. Pavement is cracked and 
broken underfoot, with regions carrying the telltale signs of fire's scorch and 
melted parts of plastic-base building components. The scent of the toxic lake 
mingles with that of burnt flesh and property. 


   A crude barricade has crafted of alion sheets welded together and lined with 
barbed wire, blocking off the west.

East and West on Main Street~
   This stretch of Main Street was once wide and bare with only crumbling 
edges, but is now widely consumed by the debris from recent fire damage. The 
asphalt now is a single, dark layer of sooty trash and burnt rubble; the smells 
of both permeate the air and singe the nostrils. The few, disrepaired 
buildings that once loomed to either side of the road have been reduced to 
broken remains of their former past. The bits of graffiti that once lined the

South of a Tool Shop~
   Jagged cracks have been filled with sooty debris through the asphalt along 
this stretch of Main Street, causing the previous attempts at repair to be 
shrouded beneath the layer of reeking trash and rubble. The storefronts and 
businesses that once lined the street have been, for the most part, abandoned 
and looted, leaving only the ragged shells of the buildings to remain in broken 
silence.

Main Street, East of Umbra Road~
   The wide road of Main Street runs east and west through the center of 
Grungetown. Its pavement is now covered in a topping of heat-compacted trash 
and asphalt. The once, higher-quality buildings that lined either side of the 
road have been fire-licked to fade in memory, leaving only the abandoned 
edifices behind and the customers gone. Only a handful of people seem to move 
through this part of street during any given cycle.

The Fire-Ravaged Intersection of Main Street and Umbra Road~
   Main Street runs east and west here, intersecting the wide and rubble-ridden 
street of Umbra Road which cuts a path north and south through broken rinds of 
exposed, warped buildings. The little traffic that once milled through this 
now scorched street has been reduced even further, with only a handful of souls 
passing through the cracked and burnt roadway, most milling east or west; the 
once hazardous potholes and cracks in the asphalt have been layered with a 
fragile layer of sooty garbage.

Main Street, West of the Warped Umbra Road~
   The wide, waste-ridden road of Main Street continues east and 
west in a straight, but nontheless ragged line, cutting through 
the center of Grungetown. The road is weathered and layered with 
an extra topsoil consisting of broken, busted plastic and 
scorched metal. Old, concrete buildings and their facades are 
left embittered by the aftermath of fire, swept with sooty ash 
and blackened outsides, displaying their scars on either side of 
the street.

detritus-filled crossroad. What once was a busy intersection now lacks

roadway westward that leads into nothing but a debris-strewn pit of quiet. 
   A crude barricade made of makeshift metal and rubble has been pulled to the 
west and south.

Before the Broken West Gate~
   This once highly fortified gate has suffered enough damage 
that it now is unhinged and causes this part of Grungetown to be 
completely susceptible to the horrors of what once was protected 
by the Perimeter. Rubble is strewn and broken underfoot, cracked 
cement the only remains from the once looming buildings.

plates and seems to be the only edifice in the town that has been 
continually repaired. It is structurally-sound with a walkway 
visible running along the top of the wall while its length has

   A heavily fortified gate rises up to the west formed of thick,

moonscape. The gate itself is rectangular in shape and a walkway 
runs right across it, visible up above.

   Large chunks of concrete run along the side of Junkyard Row, 
pushed to the edges out of the way of the heavy traffic that 
constantly flows here. The street continues down a path of 
abandoned buildings, though the building to the west is occupied 
by a shop, its sign crudely hanging above the door. Other, 
smaller structures were even once built atop of some of the 
toppled foundations - shanties constructed of salvaged materials 
from the now skeletal remains.

Quiet Junkyard Remains, South of Main Street~
   The passage through the remains of Junkyard Row is a weaving, snake tread 
pattern in between the collapsed ruins of buildings. Old pieces of foundation 
have been heaved up from their resting places around charred craters, pieces 
laying at sporadic intervals. It is not a flat portion of land: mostly, this 
area is completely covered in heaps of rubble. Except for the scuttling of 
wildlife, settling of debris, and howl of the wind this portion of blasted 
street is quiet. Faintly, the sounds of life further to the north occasionally 
drift through.

concrete have been pushed to the side of the road, out of the way of the heavy 
traffic. Ruined buildings are visible along Main Street to the west, and while 
most of the storefronts lining Junkyard Row seem cramped and useless, at least 
many of them are still standing. Junkyard Row continues north, toward the 
Perimeter gate visible far in the distance, and south, while Main Street heads 
east and west as far as the eye can see.

Junkyard Row Between Main Street and the Market~
 What shops haven't fallen prey to destruction and into 
collapsed ruin have been ravaged by fire, standing abandon with 
the boards falling from their windows. Old stands have been 
hurled about, overturned. Though, the nearer the gate one gets, 
the more buildings seem to be standing. What ones there are, 
even so, are riddled with bullet holes and marred by war and 
battle. Scraps and garbage are everywhere, drifting on the lunar 
winds which also bring the scent of rotting and burnt flesh. 
   To the west stands a partially fire-blackened warehouse, the 
painting of men in red and blue fighting each other marked by 
fire's tongue. To the north is a battered, but strong, iron 
gate. You realize you must #6CALL GATEGUARD#0 to proceed any

A Trash-Filled Intersection Before the North Gate (Oil Road and Baseline Ave.)~
   A small clearing forms here as the northern gatehouse rises overhead, #2a 
massive#0 #1red 'W'#0 painted over the passageway, its sturdy walls set in 
stark contrast to the shanties and makeshift hovels which littler the 
surrounding area. Acrid smoke wafting through the immediate area in seemingly 
unending fashion finds its origins amidst burning piles of trash and refuse 
scattered carelessly within the clearing which also serves as an intersection 
of sorts. Throngs of people pass through here in all directions, the majority 
of their faces dirty and betraying a life of hardship inflicted by the chaotic 
overcrowding which surrounds the area. A small path, barely wide enough for 
the passing caravans which have unearthed deep ruts from the ground beneath, 
winds deeper into the slums southwards while similar paths snake both east and 
west, keeping close to the northern walls.

   Some of the polycrete shops still loom in dour silence along this stretch of 
street, the windows and chunks of polycrete blasted violently from their 
exterior. The entire street is littered with pieces of structures that didn't 
fare so well, plastic and glass glinting dangerously in duller heaps. Except 
for the occasional humans that pass through, and small animals, this place is 
barren and mostly lifeless. Small hints are returning, as little weeds crop up 
here and there out of the debris.

is little more than a hollowed out and blackened skeleton. Pieces of the walls 
sag inwards, folding over each other. Much of the asphalt has lifted up,

A Bend East and South on Main Street~
   What few buildings remain creak and groan with exertion of their supports, 
some slumped nearer to the street as lower portions have been stripped away. 
The street itself is heavily cracked, pieces giving way to dust. Small gusts 
of air whip it up into miniature dust devils. Occasionally, some rubble falls 
down, clattering against that below to topple into the mostly cleared street. 
The heavily beaten street turns to the south here, past collapsed and shattered 
shops. To the north stands an abandoned warehouse, a pair of heavy-metal doors 
looming at the entrance, a battered handscanner having been set alongside them.

occasional shanty still tenuously clinging to an upright position. A subtle 
scent of human rot flows on the wind, mixing with that of the lunar desert and 
less obvious stench of sewage. It is quiet, except for the groan and settle of 
rubble, and the scuttling of small animals.

Rubble-Strewn Intersection of Main and Revolutionary~

either cleared out or untouched except for large amounts of spiderweb cracks 
through the pavement. Except for the occasional distant gunshot, cry of some 
wild creature, or the howl of the moon's winds this area is incredibly quiet. 
Much of the surrounding ruins are in worse order, the streets branching off

   Husks of buildings still remain partially standing, though those that have 
not have jagged pieces of metal support beams sticking out at dangerous angles. 
What is still upright is almost skeletal in appearance, with the windows blown 
out and much of the layers pealed away. The scent of charred earth and flesh 
hangs in the air, adding to the scorch marks on some of the building materials. 
Entire portions of foundation and pavement have sunk into the ground, partially 
revealing the sewers underneath. Trickles of water can be glimpsed from the 
occasional set of broken pipes.

deserted, with crumbling corners and sunken roofs, but others are piles of 
hazardous rubble, rife with sharp edges and protruding beams. Large chunks of

whatever was at hand to prevent free passage of friend or foe. It extends into 
the murky water of Crater Lake, keeping most things at bay in that direction 
unless they come from the water itself. To the west, a rubble-strewn street is 
still passable, but to the north the remains of East Street have been choked

North Street Nearing a Bend~
   North Street runs east as far as the eye can see, past the 
crumbling north gate visible in the distance. To the west, the 
singed and beatean road nears a bend where the cracked and burnt 
Perimeter begins to curve southward. A cluster of shambled 
buildings, each blown to varying degrees of uselessness, stands 
to the south, their plastic roofs warped by heat. The remainder 
of the buildings that once stood is hardly worth looking upon, 
serving their purpose best as shadows in the brightest and 
hottest of days. There is little traffic here, though at times a 
throng of people can be seen to the east.

East and South Along the Perimeter, West of the North Gate~
   This dingy side-street hugs the remains of the broken wall of 
the Perimeter as it turns east and south here, then widens into 
the east-to-west length of North Street. The loose trash that 
once scattered in the wind has been replaced by feathery, charred 
remains. A small, battered intersection can be seen to the 
south, where the warped side-street connects with Darkness Drive. 
There is only a small amount of traffic here, though the sound of 
people near the splintered gate to the northeast echoes in from 
the distance.

Along the Perimeter Wall, South of North Street~
   Caugh between the looming wall of the Perimeter to the west 
and the scorched, burnt ramshackle rubble of buildings to the 
east, this area is permeated by dappled shadow for most of the 
day. The road is broken and singed, the asphalt caking and 
sticking beneath. The buildings that line the street are little 
more than melted shanties, with crumbling concrete walls patched 
with warped plastic and bent, blackened wood. There is little 
traffic here, though the sound of some crowds can be heard at the 
north gate and to the northeast.

An Intersection on Darkness Drive~
   Narrow side-streets cut a sharp path north and south through 
Darkness Drive, which stretches east and west as far as the eye 
can see. A cramped path heads northward, hugging the looming 
wall of the Perimeter, which in the near distance turns toward 
the east. To the south, a dank alley leads through fire-ravaged 
homes and abandoned buildings. This area is trafficked by few 
people save those heading east toward a larger intersection, 
visible in the distance.

Darkness Drive, East of Umbra Road~
   This quiet, gloomy, blackened block intersects with Umbra Road 
to the west; that area is now as subdued and empty as this one. 
What little traffic flows along this stretch of Darkness Drive 
generally heads further east toward the charred remains of the 
city, toward the Market in the distance. A few, fire-ravaged 
structures line the street, burnt shells of shanties with sooty 
metal walls distorted by fire and tagged with faded, fire-licked 
graffiti. Trash and burnt rubble are scattered on the ground, 
though not deep enough to impede travel.

Darkness Drive Meets Rubble Strewn Umbra Road~
   Umbra Road dead ends here, at the northern wall of the 
Perimeter, and intersects Darkness Drive. This section of the 
Perimeter is made of overlapping plates of thick metal, and looms 
high above the street. There is little traffic, as the western 
side of the street is lined by the burnt husks of shanties and 
the eastern side by the ruins of shops. A hush hangs over the 
area, broken by an occasional squeak or scurrying that sounds 
from within the rubble.

The Stage~
   This brown-splashed stage is surrounded in a wide semicircle 
by tiers and tiers of red velour fold-down seats, designed so 
that the audience's attention will be focused entirely upon the 
stage and its performance. Either side of the stage are two 
tall, voluminous red curtains, held with tatty golden polyprop 
cords. The wings to backstage are just out of sight from the 
audience, too. The stage itself is spacious, more akin to a 
square than the typical rectangular shape.

Battered Northwest Corner of the Perimeter~
   The intersection of Main Street and West Street is sandwiched 
between the looming and broken edifice of the Perimeter and the 
battered remains of one looming buildings. The debris covers up 
the potholes in the pavement underfoot, but also layers to create 
an uneven terrain that is hazardous to most passing through. The 
stench of wrecked plastic and metal reeks and lingers in the air, 
a powerful stench. The broken remains of Main Street stretch 
eastward, while West Street heads in shambles toward the nearly 
unhinged West Gate.

Nearing a Broken Bend on Darkness Drive~
   The broken wall of the Perimeter looms to the north of the 
street, a cracked and rubble-ridden bulwark that, in its wrecked 
state, is makeshift in its protection against outer threats. 
Darkness Drive follows its length past a row of crumbling, 
fire-scorched structures; metallic husks of hosues and 
fire-ravaged concreate walls stand near piles of misshapen 
rubble. A faint scratching is sometimes heard here, and a 
sickly-sweet odor occasionally wafts past through the sharp 
stench of burnt trash. The street runs east as far as the eye 
can see, though to the west, a bend in the road is visible.

A Broken Bend East and South on Darkness Drive~
   The looming, concrete-and-metal wall of the injured Perimeter 
runs north of the street, turning slightly here, and again just 
to the south. Darkness Drive follows its contours, cluttered 
with trash and rubble, winding past burnt shells of buildings. 
The few buildings that have been the least damaged stand charred 
and battered, so rickety that they appear ready to topple over at 
any moment. Travelers rarely pass this way, though the sound of 
the marketplace can sometimes, if rarely, be heard in the 
distance.

   Darkness Drive bends north and west here, in the dappled 
shadow of the broken, northern wall of the Perimeter. The 
previous, old husks of homes that once stood have been demolished 
by a more recent, cruel attack upon their structures, lining the 
fire-scorched walkway with warped plastic and tarnished metal. 
There is little traffic here, though the very faint sound of 
vendors shouting prices occasionally echoes over the few, intact 
structures remaining.

Buzzard Boulevard Meets the Crumbling Northern Perimeter~
   Buzzard Boulevard and Darkness Drive intersect here, the former heading 
south through the ravaged, rubble-strewn outer limits of Grungetown, the latter 
winding north and west. The high rise of the once strong Perimeter rises 
overhead, now casting a crumbling shadow upon most of this burnt intersection. 
The road is a mixture of tarnished metal bits and crumbling remains of 
buildings and metal, still unpacked due to the decreased flow of traffic. To 
the west, deeper into the rubble, a squat building has been protected by layers 
of sheet metal stacked against its sides, allowing it to remain intact.

south. The pavement underfoot has been shocked with a scorching 
blast that has caused it to be slick and uneven, worse than from 
its previous disrepair. The warped and tarnished metal and 
plastic debris littering the ravaged street has made this part of 
road practically impassable.

west crumbles around its recent repairs, due to extensive heat 
damage. Among the fire-warped and tragically demolished 
buildings along the eastern edge of the street are only a few 
that remain even upright. The road is littered with 
fire-scorched debris, making moving through this part of the 
street a rather obnoxious sojourn. 
   To the north, Buzzard Boulevard meets the rattled Darkness 
Drive, which turns east along the northern Perimeter wall.

   The flow of traffic is supremely light here, due to the rubble 
obstacles underfoot. The buildings that previously stood here 
have been shucked away at the husks, leaving only the skeletal 
remains of warped metal frames behind in the dust. Trash, 
combined with the burnt plastic and metal remains collect in 
corners and clog the large potholes within the road. To the 
west, the stark and once mighty Perimeter now rises in shambles. 
Further north, Buzzard Boulevard meets Darkness Drive.

   Stretching all the way to the southern Perimeter wall, West 
Street continues down a long-abandoned cluster of buildings 
blocking any travel eastwards. Most of the buildings have 
toppled, or look near it, and those that are not have been 
heavily boarded over. Rising up to the west is the outer defense 
against threats to Grungetown, the Perimeter wall. The 
relatively close proximity of both the wall and the buildings 
keep the street in shade for most of the day, and combined with 
the constant flow of traffic coming in from the West gate 
situated just north, little grows here.

uninhabitable and looted, ashy metal shells ravaged by heat. 
Large chunks of asphalt are missing from the road, making the

   Most of the buildings along this stretch of road have been 
completely withered by fire and sport creaking roofs and 
crumbling, warped foundations. The remains of a large complex 
lay to the east, the rubble and twisted steel within indicating 
an inward collapse pockmarked by the markings of fire. The faint 
murmur of voices can sometimes be heard to any who might tread 
through the shambled street. 

The broken road runs north toward the broken Perimeter and south, 
past an intersection, deeper into the city. Only a few 
pedestrians linger or wander this scorched part of street.

difficult to call the burnt-out husks and skeletons of supports 
buildings at all. Here or there a wall still stands, but other

Not a single building rises in the ruin skirting either side of

melted plastic and scattered concrete and ruined metal. The 
rubble is scattered across the street, catching in potholes and 
along the crumbling foundations, rendering it almost impassable 
save for by the most careful of feet. The bleak street of 
Buzzard Boulevard continues north and south, though here the 
wreckage abates enough on either side for passage, where two 
narrow side-streets branch through the ruin.

An Annihilated Part of Buzzard Boulevard, South of Wilmington Way~
   Burnt trash and shattered concrete chunks litter this part of 
roadway, causing travel to be nigh impossible. The storefronts 
that once lined this section of street have fallen into 
desolation; completely broken and bruised, blackened in what 
remains of their inner frames. To the north, a nearly impassable 
three-way intersection is visible, if one can see through the 
rubble.

The Battered Intersection of Buzzard Boulevard and Wilmington Way~
   What was once a decent portion of road is now in complete 
shambles. Abandoned and completely destroyed buildings creak and 
teeter away from their mottled frames, occasionally spilling to 
add extra obstacles in the way of this once well-traveled part of 
town. What was once Buzzard Boulevard continues in broken 
remains north to hug the wrecked Perimeter wall, while far to the 
south, amidst concrete ruins does Wilmington Way continue 
eastward.

A Quiet, Broken Intersection on Buzzard Boulevard~
   This broken length of Buzzard Boulevard continues north and 
south, at the very least an obstacle course with the 
fire-scorched rubble littering the once paved and fine section of 
town. Occasionally, beneath the layer of ground down, blackened 
sediment, one might find a burnt remain of a rubbery sex-toy or 
other piece of self-pleasure equipment, though most who travel 
through this shambled byway do not linger long in the ashes.

   This stretch of Buzzard Boulevard, once complete with traffic 
and noise is now desolate beneath the cracked shadow of the 
Perimeter. A sloppy layer of burnt remains litter the once 
potholed gravel beneath, causing an even more uneven intersection 
to travel upon. The area is desolate, even compared to the 
overly thinned out population that can sometimes be seen passing 
along the remains of Main Street to the north.

   Umbra Road continues to run north and south, its asphalt scorched and 
cracked by heat damage. What were once relatively steady, hunched, and squat 
buildings are now mostly remains of prior glory; their metal and plastic faces 
worn, pocked and melted, tarnished from blasts of fire. There is very little 
traffic along this street, if ever, and most of it passes to the north where 
Main Street and Umbra Road intersect.

plastic and metal rubble decaying from the burnt frames of the structures 
lining the road. Faded and scorched-off graffiti adorns what remains of the

desolate feel. Umbra Road intersects Main Street far to the north, and

into a myriad of rubbly mixture, plastic melding onto tarnished, bent metal; 
some of the debris has fallen into what were once hazardous potholes, jutting 
out to cause even more obstacles in the way of traffic. The road continues 
north and south, though to the south, the intersection with Wilmington Way is

Crumbling Intersection of Umbra Road and Wilmington Way~
   What were once only minimally dilapidated buildings are now rubble and 
impeding barriers upon and along this walkway. Large chunks of fire-scorched 
metal and warped plastic litter the roadway as well, inhibiting plantlife and 
travel by extraordinary levels. Wilmington Way snakes in its broken state east 
and west, while Umbra Road leads north and south. 
   A crude barricade has been pulled to the west and spans to the south.

North and South on Umbra Road, Picking through Ruin~
   A vague, wide swath of relatively clean space cuts through the 
mounds of desolate, destroyed ruin here; this is Umbra Road, and 
it is only considered clean relative to the rubble on either 
side. It runs north and south, coated in a layer of trash and 
debris. The smell of burnt plastic and metal is heavy in the

irrepairable shambles, is visible to the west where Wilmington 
Way meets the decay of Buzzard Boulevard. Abandoned buildings 
that once stood proud despite their graffiti-littered faces now 
litter the ground, causing would-be traffic an obstacle course of 
excruciatingly obnoxious heights. Potholes pock the 
rubble-strewn asphalt, causing even further annoyance and danger 
in crossing this stretch of road.

the destroyed buildings. To the west tremendous piles of smashed 
concrete and twisted metal, all scorched and made black by fire, 
are heaped. The road nearly concealed by the rubble which has 
spilled onto it, making passage by foot precarious and difficult. 
Further south the rim of the surface of Crater Lake can be seen. 
Despite the utter descruction of the area, a lone, dull red 
building stands to one side of the road, its windows and door 
blown out.

A Collapsed End of the Perimeter at the Rim of the Lake~
   Where once the Perimeter stood, now it lies in a huge heap of 
twisted metal and melted plastic. Supports rise occasionally 
from the rubble, bent and broken, like the ribcage of a long dead 
animal. The hovels and shacks and buildings that used to line 
this street are now in various states of destruction; some have 
collapsed wholly while others stand as mere skeletons of what 
they used to be. The high rim of the crater in which the Lake 
sits rises to the east. Amidst the descrution stands a small, 
burnt out building, it's concrete walls blackened. A rickety 
door just hangs on its hinges in the doorframe.

looted buildings with crumbling, plastic-warped walls and 
heat-bent metal roofs. The remains of what once was the tallest 
building is now a crumbled ruin of rusted and tarnished metal 
beams and fallen concrete columns. The gravel roadway has been 
scorched into oblivion, causing traffic to slow around the 
obstacles within the path. The sparse traffic that does move 
through usually heads toward the intersection of Umbra Road and 
Wilmington Way to the west.

gravel and trash-ridden walkway. Wilmington Way continues east

is a regular sound to be comforted by any longer. Along the 
southern portion of the road, half obscured by rubble, is a small 
hatchway set into the ground.

sediment beneath a layer of scorched-smelling filth. The sounds 
that once permeated the Grungetown air here from the 
once-inhabited shanties inside the park is a rare thing now. A

own personal pile of burnt trash, the only noteable thing in the

and Junkyard Row. Buildings of already unsteady construction have been sent 
tumbling to the ground, little more than burnt out husks and rubble remaining 
in evidence. The street itself is wholly destroyed in places, jagged strips of 
of asphalt allowing an uneasy progress. Shanties line the streets, recently 
erected and already crowded. Amidst the wreckage is a mostly intact sewer 
grate, the metal warped by the surrounding destruction.

street to the east. A few solitary shanties litter the wide intersection, 
boarded-up shop-fronts evident in the barely-standing remains of stone and 
steel buildings. Debris is everywhere, spat out from surrounding destruction, 
and few Grungers pass this close to the destruction. Half-obscured in the 
nearby rubble is a small utility hatch set into the ground.

concrete and all manner of burnt trash fill the gaps between the 
charred chunks of dismantled plastic and ravaged metal. Almost 
nothing remains of the asphalt that once paved the street, the 
ground is covered by singed dirt and broken gravel. Little 
traffic passes this way; people rarely tarry here, most often 
heading east to a large, burnt intersection of roads in the 
distance. Not far to the west is a much smaller intersection 
that meets the ruined remains of the Perimeter where it curves 
north and east.

despite the occasional gloom and the abandoned, blackened shops 
lining the road, the area is hardly desolate. Meager crowd noise

of decay hangs in the air like a horrible perfume.

North Street Before a Blackened Crater~
   Along the north side of this street, the high concrete wall of 
the perimeter rises, sections of it blackened and cracked. 
Dipping down to the east, a massive crater has been carved out of 
the land, surface fused together into a field of cracked and

East and West Along the Northern Perimeter~
   This battered section of street runs parallel to the northern 
wall, hence its name: "North Street." Stained concrete, mixed 
with occasional chunks of scrap metal, rises high above, dwarfing 
all other structures nearby. The air is particularly dank here, 
and the stench is especially oppressive. Compacted trash rustles 
underfoot, though with the Perimeter casting the entire area into 
shadow, it is unclear as to exactly what filth has accumulated in 
the street.

North Street Nearing Revolutionary Way~
   Along the north side of this street, the high concrete wall of the perimeter 
rises, sections of it blackened and cracked. Dipping down to the west, a 
massive crater has been carved out of the landscape, surface fused together 
into a field of cracked and blackened glass. The road stops abruptly at the 
rim, shattered surface rippling away from the crater. Some distance further to 
the west, the crater rises back up to meet the other half of the remains of 
North Street as it heads toward the remains of the Market.

Desolate, Damaged East Street, North of East Gate~
   Most of the perimeter remains standing, putting this rubble-strewn part of 
the street into some form of shadow. Except for the occasional gunshots, or 
far off cry of either human or animal, this area is largely quiet. Pieces of 
plastic and polycrete litter the street, showing weathered remains of graffiti. 
Some of the buildings have a distinctively war torn look, though a number are 
still standing if badly damaged.

North Street, West of Revolutionary Way~
   Rubble from the surrounding buildings has been partially cleared from this 
section of North Street, buildings nearby showing few signs of life. The high 
polycrete wall of the perimeter stretches along the northern side of the road, 
blackened and cracked in a number of places. To the west, the street continues 
before suddenly meeting the large expanse of a crater that takes up much of the 
area, while to the east the battered street intersects with Revolutionary Way.

surrounded on all sides by rubble and further signs of destruction. The scent 
of rot, burnt materials and flesh, and explosives lingers in the air at varying 
degrees. Little signs of life, except for the occasional rat or lizard are to 
be seen. The street itself is still able to be traversed to the east or the 
west, but shows signs of attack with the jagged leaps and cracks in the 
pavement.

hulk of concrete. The occasional passer-by moves this way, the destruction 
worse in either direction, though the street does remain mostly intact. 
Southward, a massive pile of trash can be seen, and from all around the faint 
smell of rot can be detected, along with the sound of small creatures 
skittering through the rubble.

Rubble of Revolutionary Way, South of What was Lover's Lane~
   Trash and torn up pieces of asphalt and concrete litter the area profusely, 
making any passage through precarious at best. Most of the streets are next to 
impassible without climbing, the shelters smashed into pieces or buried 
underneath rubble. Hollowed, solitary walls can still be seen, barely visible 
as still standing underneath the dust and detritus. Laying in the heaps is a 
piece of wall with a faded and battered encircled letter "A".

   Twisted shards of metal have been torn out of what was once a sturdy, metal 
wall that made up the perimeter. They scatter in the thick grey dust on both 
sides, showing a concussive force from the interior. Pieces of polycrete, 
ripped up asphalt, and trash are everywhere, piling high in what can barely be 
determined as the remains of a street running east and south; passage would 
either take careful footing or to have the mess cleared completely.

   Between the torn metal shards of the perimeter wall to the north and the 
mounds of trash churned from the remnants of the town, this place strongly 
resembles a dump heap. Skeletons of burnt out and partially collapsed 
buildings and hovels can just be made out, marked with areas that have 
smoldered. The stench of char lingers in the air. To the east, the perimeter 
has partially collapsed, folding down over the road and making passage 
dangerous.

Rubble-Strewn Heaps of Lover's Lane~
   Either a ruin or a landfill, a street that once ran east and west is now 
guarded by burnt out shells of buildings. The top layer of garbage and hard 
refuse is mobile and unsteady footing, sliding out easily when pressure is 
placed on it. Destroyed surfaces with graffiti give a picture similar to a 
macabre playing board, spelling out half-words and creating a vague map. South 
of here, the area is even more treacherous, with jagged bones of dwellings 
sticking up or giving way steeply.

mixed with shards of steel from the damaged portions of the perimeter wall. 
Most of the area is completely covered with this and pieces of building and 
pavement, making passage nearly impossible.

They glitter like diamonds, or sticking up in some places like deadly little 
spikes. This edge of the perimeter is still somewhat intact, but in some 
places the metal is sagging, and on occasion a faint screech can be heard as 
pieces tear with some pressure. An occasional old house, beaten by the 
destruction, still stubbornly half-stands with its singed walls and blown out 
windows. Most remnants are buried under refuse from the destruction, but to 
the west and south across the heaps and piles it's worse.

littered with trash and remnants of several collapsed buildings, making it

buildings can be seen still standing. All around the signs of destruction are

charred earth surrounding it.

   The sights and scents of destruction are marked all over this area, most of 
the buildings destroyed directly to the north. Cracks run along the asphalt, 
and detritus of human life has been churned up. Dust drifts in the air 
whenever some rubble tumbles nearby, making footing unsteady, and passage near 
to the destroyed buildings treacherous. Where chunks of rubble haven't 
completely obscured the street is the battered shape of a block letter white: 
"N." North Street continues in ruins. West, it meets Revolutionary Way.

flesh hangs heavily over this area. What was once alleyways are almost 
completely impassible, riddled with a jungle of beams and twisted metal 
building supports. Where garbage and rubble haven't clotted the area, leaking

To the north, the vague remains of two buildings can be made out, with a 
collapsed walkway in between.

   The twisted skeleton of the perimeter looms in the east, standing tall over 
the frequently hushed streets. Many of the buildings in this area have 
collapsed either partially or completely, littering the edges of a mostly 
passable street. The asphalt carries a number of uneven cracks, pieces jerking 
up suddenly out of the mounds of trash and rubble. Looking closely, it's 
possible to make out the remains of a large block letter in white: "N."

   Once grand buildings have collapsed in on themselves and the street, leaving 
only one or two walls standing on the more complete ones. Glass, polycrete, 
and asphalt settle in shards amidst dust and the occasional charred body part 
from some unseen person. All of this is partially swallowed my a massive, 
blackened crater which has taken several of the buildings down into it. A 
distinct aroma of old, burnt flesh hangs over the area without any clear 
source. Further to the east, jaggedly ripped and blown out sections of the 
perimeter wall stand like crooked teeth.

A Mostly Untouched Intersection of East and Darkness~
   While all around the asphalt seems pitted and slanted away, torn from its 
former state of pavement, this portion seems mostly untouched. There's even an 
occasional house that still stands, forlornly sentinel above the intersection. 
Fire has run its course here, even so, and there are clear marks of char along 
the sides. A subtle hint of burnt flesh, hair, and upholstery can be detected 
on the dry moon air. Nearby, partially obscured in the rubble, is a small 
utility hatch that has been set into the ground. 
   Near to the eastern door of a still standing building has been placed a 
handscanner. It is possible to #6HANDSCAN#0 to open the #6EAST#0 door.

fought their way mostly free of collapsed buildings before dying. Small 
animals skitter through the ruins, picking at the corpses, or hiding if

still stand, though their position is precarious at best. The street is 
passable, with the sidewalks knocked about, leading north and south.

North and South on Revolutionary Way~
   Shards and sheets of buildings have been thrown about without rhyme or 
reason, some half-laying in a massive crater where a building might once have 
stood. The others on either side sink down into it, toppling over and strewing 
pieces of metal, glass, and plastic everywhere. Most have been rocked back, 
falling in on themselves, away from the sight of the impact. Cracks scatter 
and spread out from it, carving clefts into the ruined asphalt. Nearby, half 
obscured in the rubble, is a utility-hatch set into the ground.

North and South on Revolutionary Way, Amidst Rubble~
   Though blasted and beaten, the buildings in this area largely still stand in 
stubborn silence. Almost all are missing their windows in entirety, and some 
sag to the side on damaged supports. Chunks of asphalt have been lifted up, 
making any passage uneven and somewhat precarious. Sheets of metal peel down 
and jut out, threatening potential harm for the unwary. 
   A crude barricade of makeshift materials has been pulled to the south.

Dusty, Rubbly Remnants of Stores~
   Glinting bits of plastic and metal litter this area, some surprisingly free 
of rust or dust. Of those things, however, this area has a plentiful supply. 
Most of it is dust, or smaller chunks of rubble torn from what was once 
buildings. The unwary are liable to get it into their boots, eyes, or 
clothing. Larger, sharper pieces stick out as traps for those who aren't 
careful. The occasional moon lizard or rat can be scuttling through the 
remnants, or a vulture picking at some poor bastard who didn't survive.

Revolutionary Way, North of Wilmington Way~
   Save for the settling of rubble here, and the howl of the lunar winds, this 
portion of dessicrated Grungetown is rather quiet. Part of the city sinks into 
the ground, where the sewers have been exposed by the pounding of explosions. 
It is dark, only beams of sunlight from above during the day cycles serving to 
shed some illumination on the pipes below. Most of the rest of the street has 
been bombed into submission, the buildings collapsed and littering the street 
heavily.

Outside the Exploded Remains of a Pool Hall~
   One of the most notable pieces of rubble that dots this area is a large, 
green felt pool table. It's blackened, and all of the legs have been broken 
off, but there it sits. The remains of what was once La Revolution appear to 
have exploded from the inside out, bar stools and pieces of floor and wall are 
everywhere. Many of the other buildings are in a similar state, though they 
appear to have imploded instead. A large crater mars the center of the area, 
swallowing up some of the refuse.

only decor. The loud, 'click' of billiards balls can be heard, 
echoing out into the street and pool tables can be spied through 
the door every time it opens.

Ruin Nearing the End of Umbra Road~
   The road is largely dust and gravel in his area, covered in a 
solid, ankle-deep layer of trash. Either side of the street is 
lined by the blackened remains of abandoned shops, crumbling 
cement walls standing in silent tribute around heaps of rubble. 
The smell of burnt concrete is all-consuming here, inescapable. 
To the east, a metal fence encases the sea of collapsed, 
fire-ruined shanties packed inside what was once Wilmington Park. 
To the west there stands a low concrete hallway, its doorway 
nearly hidden amongst the piles of rubble.

End of Umbra Road at the Edge of Crater Lake~
   Umbra Road ends here, at the edge of Crater Lake. Most of the 
pavement in this area was long ago torn from the street, with 
only a few scraps remaining. Instead, a narrow trail of packed 
earth snakes east and west along the rocky rim of the crater 
where the ground is slightly elevated. The western side of the 
road is lined by flattened and burnt-out shopfronts, collapsed 
into ruin, and the eastern side is similar: a sea of scorched 
rubble, what were once shanties, filling the remains of 
Wilmington Park.

A Little Trail Against the Rim of Crater Lake~
   A small trail, relatively clear of debris and rubble, clings 
to the side of Crater Lake, snaking eastward from the wider 
street to the west. A few collapsed buildings, in various states 
of destruction, can be seen nearby. To the south, the slush of 
the lake's surface glistens in the faint light, where it's not 
marred by floating bits of rubble.

   North of this narrow, snaking trail lies more of the ruin of 
Grungetown, with but a few burnt-out frames or supports still 
standing above the mounds of collapsed buildings and rubble. Yet 
this trail, little more than hard-packed dirt, is clean in 
comparison, with naught but shards of glass and metal and trash 
scattered about. Bits of garbage float upon the toxic surface of 
Crater Lake to the south. The area is usually hushed, with just 
the lappings of the lake water and the occasional scuffling of 
feet or trash to be heard.

Edge of Crater Lake, Trail Meeting a Ruined Junkyard Row~
   This rocky path branches off to the west away from the main 
street of Junkyard Row to the east. It snakes along the curve of 
the crater's edge where water has formed a lake in the bowl of 
the depression. The surface of the lake is a thick gray sludge, 
and emits foul odors - even from here the smell is noticeably 
horrible, especially when the drifting smell of burning drifts in 
from the north, where, stopping a few feet away from the path, 
the rubble spreading from the rest of the town comes.

Collapsed Shanties Along the Edge of Crater Lake~
   The narrow path continues here east and west along the rocky 
edge of crater path. The ground underfoot is slightly elevated 
due to the crater's rim and proved unstable for the many shanties 
that were once built here; they have all since fallen into piles 
of rubble, the sheet-metal and junkyard scraps of many blackened 
by the lick of flames. To the south, the icy slush of water that 
fills the bowl of the crater forms Crater Lake.

little more than well-trodden dirt in the ground with trash or 
glass shards tossed carelessly to the side. It avoids most of 
the higher elevation along the rim of the crater, though is 
limited by the heaps of fire-ruined rubble on top of what was 
once Wilmington Park to the north. To the south is Crater Lake, 
the surface of the water filled with icy slush. Deeper into the 
murky darkness of the lake can be noticed a greyed, solid block 
of ice. Every inch of it, ice or liquid, is a thick, 
poisonous-looking gray.

Rubble at the Edge of Crater Lake~
   Blackened rubble, likely once slum housing, is heaped here 
against the rim of the Lake, forcing the trail to snake around, 
extremely close to the edge of the lake. One house, having been 
partially-built on some of the elevated ground here, has 
collapsed in upon itself, leaving behind a pile of rubble. The 
trail continues west here with a bend heading north. The 
somewhat raised elevation of the ground always a good look of the 
vast ruin spreading to the north: just piles upon piles of 
scorched rubble and trash.

lifeless. The path here heads east to where Junkyard Row can be

   The fact that this road was once in poor condition matters 
not, now that it has been wrecked completely. Torn asphalt has 
been veiled by a layer of sooty grime and chunks of every sort of 
building material available. Rusted metal siding just out of the 
ground like dead hands, hoping to catch unsuspecting passersby 
with their sharp corners and lurching metal sides. The 
rubble-strewn park is now completely silent, not even the 
occasional ratta-tat-tat of gunfire is heard as it was frequently 
before this silence-bearing chaos ensued.

similar to the one which hems in this small area. To the distant 
east, the reason becomes obvious: this used to be the entrance 
before a large manor, which is now but a fire-blackened, 
collapsed husk. Before the entrance lays a large gate emblazoned 
with a stylish 'W', but the same ruin which wrecked the building 
cast it down.

a stretch of settlement. Grey chunks of pavement and scrap metal are strewn

lunar winds drifts the scent of charred flesh and dry dust. The only sounds

Collapsed Region West of an Intersection in the Park~
   From the demolished ruins of a building to the south, a mostly rotted hand 
can barely be made out, reaching up desperately through the rubble. It's 
missing several fingers, and portions of the decomposing flesh appear to have 
been ripped at by teeth of some sort. The rest of the area is mostly fairly 
nondescript, except for the occasional piece of heaped rubble that has markings 
of some sort on it. Putting the pressure of feet on portions makes the rubble 
shift out dangerously. 
   To the south is the ruined mass of a polycrete building, twisted metal beams 
rising up out of the corpse of it. There are also pieces of smashed machinery 
that stick up, in addition to pieces of cloth, and remnants of beds. An 
occasional piece of the destruction bears a red, encircled 'A'.

everywhere. Towards the center can just be made out - now battered, blackened,

This area is largely unable to be passed through, with jagged bits of metal and 
plastic poking out and awaiting an intrepid explorer of the ever shifting 
ruins.

   Blasted craters have been mostly filled with remnants of what were numerous,

and footing frequently shifts out from whoever might dare set foot there. 
Faint sounds of occupation can be heard, from somewhere in the distance, but 
here it is mostly quiet. The only sounds that make their way to the ears are 
the groan of the abused ruins and skittering of small animals.

multiple blasts, beginning to sink into the water. On top of the ooze drifts 
various pieces of building materials, blackened and covered in dust and grime. 
In the absence of human life, some of the weeds have started to return, growing

along the top, falling down to settle in the piles and piles of ruined 
buildings. A few skeletons of buildings still stand, and the drip-drip of 
water can be heard from broken lines that haven't yet run completely dry. From 
somewhere nearby, the rank scent of feces drifts and mixes with that of burnt 
flesh and organic rot.

A Dead-End of a Dead Side-Street~
   Here the dead side-street comes to a halt, any further passage rendered 
impossible by the rubble. Scattered all around the area are smashed neon 
lights mixed in with the twisted, ruined metal and melted plastic. The smell 
of burning, mixed with a sour, worse smell, is abound, and not a soul passes 
through this area.

A Destroyed Short Side-Street off Buzzard Boulevard~
   A narrow side-street branches west off of Buzzard Boulevard to 
the east. It is covered with flame-scarred wreckage; the burnt 
out remains of hovels and buildings spill from where they once 
stood along the way. There is almost nothing standing here, save 
for the odd streetlight or twisted support post. Beneath all the 
rubble, the road is incredibly worn, what little of the asphalt 
is left has been reduced to gravel and large potholes lurk here 
and there.

covers the area, even during the daylight, due to the looming

hampering one's travel through the area. A wide warehouse stands 
to the east, blocking one's view of any of the other abandoned

   This narrow side street is lined by the ruins of shops, 
destroyed and blackened husks of former commerce. What used to 
be the walls and ceilings and even the contents of the buildings 
are scattered around and ruined, forming a layer of trash and 
wreckage atop the shoddy dirt road. The road is mostly gravel 
and dirt, with only a few chunks of asphalt remaining. Buzzard 
Boulevard is visible to the west, while the street continues to 
the east, dark and dank. A once-tall electrical tower has fallen 
from where it stood atop a now burnt-out building to the south to 
spill across the way, blocking any more travel to the east by

   The alley winds through mounds of trash and the blackened 
rubble of fire-ruined buildings and hovels, coming to a dead end 
before a crumbling concrete wall, the last remnants of a large 
building. Mounds of trash and rubble press in on all sides, 
making the narrow path even more claustrophobic. A burnt smell 
constantly wafts through the area, and the pervasive hush is 
broken only by the occasional shifting of stone or plastic or 
metal as something or other within the rubble gives away.

been cratered upwards. That slant leads towards a warped grating 
into the sewers beneath, revealed by the destruction. A small 
building which seems to have survived so much in the past, has 
finally succumbed to its grievous injuries, stone itself having 
succumbed to potent flames. The stench of decay wafts in from 
deeper down the alleyway, the quiet skittering of animals a 
constant companion.

numerous impact craters, each filled with large chunks of debris 
from the destroyed structures on either side. Some small plants 
have risen amidst the exposed moon-ground, the soft sound of 
skittering wildlife audible, with the occasional distant gunshot 
breaking the silence. Just as loud as those occasional gunshots 
is the stench of rot that fills this section of the city. 
There's a gap in the center of the alley where a particularly 
deep crater has breached into the sewers below, navigable with

An Alley Behind the Junkyard Bar~
   There is a little bit of space that allows one passage here 
behind The Doghouse and the building to the east. A door to the 
west allows passage into the bar's kitchen where the sound of 
clanging pots and pans can often be heard echoing loudly. To the 
north is a short distance of alley though passage is hazardous 
because of the rubble of old, building foundations that have been 
left behind. To the south, one can peek through the gap in the 
buildings to spy onto Main Street though it is only large enough 
to allow the smallest of people to squeeze through.

A Destroyed, Circular Court that was Previously Houses~
   The circular nature of this space can still be made out, just barely. Most 
of the pavement has been torn up or cracked, sticking jaggedly from the ground. 
Houses have collapsed into the middle except for the occasional wall, standing 
as an inorganic skeleton. Over the middle of the destruction lies a twisted 
drainage pipe, broken into several pieces. The air here is almost silent, 
except for any wildlife and the wind whistling past rubble.

Exposed Portions of a Rubble-strewn Alleyway~
   Light from above is allowed to filter down, whether from stars or the sun, 
as most of the buildings in this area have crumpled down to fill the alley with 
garbage and rubble. Small caves are formed where the larger pieces overlap, 
and the occasional rat, lizard, or insect can be glimpsed scurrying for scraps 
of food. To the west, a lone building sags, dark and damaged, but still 
providing some form of shelter if one can squeeze past the rubble. A 
treacherous walk to the east leads to more ruined buildings.

A Dead, Rubbled End of an Alley~
   A veritable jungle of slabs of tumbled polycrete, the passage through this 
alleyway is dangerous with one wrong step. The rubble shifts underfoot, 
sliding away and tumbling down the sides of the mounds. Battered walls of 
buildings still stand in some areas, but they are jaggled and crumbling, 
scorched by fire. To the east, a partially collapsed building hunkers. What 
was a door can be made out, hanging off the hinges before a doorway crossed 
with bits of ceiling. It is bright blue, marked with a crude yellow orb, the 
paint now faded, burnt, and peeling.

A Narrow Alley South of Darkness Drive~
   This narrow, dank side-street is little more than an alley, 
enclosed by the remains of collapsed, fire-ravaged shanties and 
shops. Rubble and trash cover the ground, wafting an unpleasant 
odor in the area and making it rather hard to pass through. The 
block appears to be abandoned, with no effort made to reuse any 
of the cramped, substandard homes or shoddy shops. People are 
rarely seen in this area of Grungetown, though a few are visible 
to the north, where Darkness Drive runs east and west under the 
shadow of the Perimeter.

A Turn North and East in the Alley~
   The alley twists north and east here, around the shattered 
remains of a shabby house that collapsed into the path. The 
street is buried beneath charred bits of trash and chunks of 
construction material, and one must step over the rubble in order 
to turn the corner. The remaining buildings are apparently 
abandoned, and are constructed of junk scraps and pitted concrete 
upon which fire damage is visible. The alley appears desolate to 
the east, while to the north it meets a larger road.

Nearing a Dead End in the Alley~
   The alley plunges deeper into the mass of fire-ravaged 
buildings, passing buildings which seem ready to crumble at any 
moment. Showers of cracked concrete fall occasionally from above 
as the remains of shabby stores and substandard homes tremble 
with even the slightest movement or touch. A faint rustling can 
sometimes be heard in the rubble, but people seem to avoid this 
place, and there is rarely a soul in sight. To the east, the 
alley appears to hit a dead end.

A Dead End~
   The alley dead-ends at a large mound of refuse that is piled 
at the base of the concrete wall to the east. Trash and rubble 
from the fire-ravaged buildings lining the alley is thick on the 
ground. This makes travel risky, especially when combined with 
the occasional shower of loose concrete that falls from above, 
crumbling from buildings which seem to be ready to topple at any 
moment. The only other sounds commonly breaking the silence are 
the occasional ratta-tat-tat of gunfire and the low murmur of 
people somewhere to the east.

filled with bins of loose wires and old keyboards while the 
shells of computer towers and various electronic pieces such as 
circuit boards and resistors are all messily, but logically 
organized for display for the customers, forcing them to have to 
dig through boxes to find what they're looking for. A single 
desk with a heavily-modified computer sits in the dark in the 
very back of the store with a register nearby, obviously the 
place to pay for one's items.

   There are various shelves and display areas here showing a 
myriad of items from tools, old jewelry, and even broken, 
household appliances. There seems to be no organization to the 
entire shop, the things for sale just haphazardly placed. Bare 
lightbulbs, some even cracked, just hang from their wires down 
from the ceiling to light the entire room in a raw, yellow light 
that allows customers to find their way through the maze within.

Anarchists Apartment Lobby~
   An overwhelming odor of soot and charred plastic lingers in 
the air of this small, crudely repaired complex. Hints of fire 
damage can be seen in melted sections of the walls plastic 
sheeting and large black smudges that run along the ceiling of 
the crowded foyer that makes up the ground level of the building. 
The floor space is sparsely furnished, a pair of benches rest 
along the wall near the entrance, and a small desk has been set 
up between the rickety flights of stairs that lead upwards to the 
apartments. Small crowds of grungetownians bustle to and fro 
from the stairs to the entrance frequently, their hushed tones of 
gossip creating a quiet drone of background noise.

Slums Surrounding a Radio Station (West Baseline Avenue)~
   Squat shanties and buildings crudely constructed of scrap metal, plastic 
tarpaulins and whatever material their residents could get their hands on grow 
ever-thicker here. In some cases they are literally stacked one atop the other 
in some cases as rope-ladders and ramps constructed of junk allow passage to 
the unstable heights above. Loose electrical wires, jerry-rigged from main 
power lines with duct-tape and determination, criss-cross perilously overhead, 
emanating an ever-constant buzz which is absorbed into the clamor of life 
abound in the nearby surrounds. The thick, almost sickening smell of human 
waste mixed with industry clings to the air here, puddles of its origin abound 
throughout the area constantly growing in number as residents dump their waste 
directly onto the streets. A single-story polycrete building with a large 
antenna attached to its roof stands out as a well-constructed, if not obviously 
run-down example of architecture along the wall to the north while the path 
itself continues to meander both east and west.

Thickening Slums Before an Imposing Building (East Baseline Ave.)~
   A spherical building rising to a point stands high to the south, the 
innumerably shanties and lean-tos surrounding its base kept at bay by #2an 
electrified chain-link fence#0 which circles around it, several guards visible 
maintaining vigilant watch over its north-facing entrance. Low-hanging 
electrical wires seconding occassionally as clotheslines intrude over the fence 
as they seek to provide the most basic of utility for the residents of the 
ever-thickening slums which compose the majority of this area, layered one atop 
the other as they nearly reach over the top of the imposing northern perimeter 
wall. Potholes litter the ground beneath, filled will varying liquids from the 
mundane to the unthinably foul as residents of the area seem more inclined to 
keep the foulness of the slums at bay, an endeavor met with little success.

Trash-Stren Slums Before the Eastern Gates (East Baseline Ave.)~
   Mounds of trash consisting of everything from fecal matter to scrap bits of 
unsalvaged plastic and rotting food paste line the roadway here, some burning 
and some yet to meet that fate, as it winds towards the iron gateway to the 
east, the bowels of the trash mounds serving as a constant source of 
inspiration for the rats which scurry underfoot throughout the area - gorging 
themselves upon a veritable feast fit for a rodent king. A foul smell looms 
over the air, carrying the odor of decomposing organic waste and lingering 
chemicals. Neighborhood children can regularly be seen playing in the streets, 
hurling balls of trash at each other or hurriedly setting up makeshift 
flashball courts much to the chagrin of their calling mothers who can often be 
seen looking worriedly out of the openings of the many shanties stacked atop 
each other here. #2A small, metal sign#0 has been bolted into the wall next to 
the eastern gateway, barely visible beneath the graffitti and amateur murals 
which seem to cover the rest of the wall. 

To the east is a battered, but strong, iron gate. You realize you must #6CALL

Deep Within A Dense Urban Jungle~
   Snake-like paths and trails strewn with feces and trash allows passage 
throughout this dense jungle of slum-dwellings consisting of shanties and 
lean-tos constructed of various materials ranging from metal poles and stone 
foundation blocks to sheets and plastic and scrap-metal salvaged only to be 
forced into an all-the-more dire reality. Stacked atop each other in haphazard 
fashion, the upper reaches of these dwellings are accessible by various ladders 
and ramps which have been fashioned crudely together out of a conglomeration of 
junked materials. The smell is could best be described as horrifically 
overwhelming, as human waste and odor combine with the scents of industry to 
form a particularly potent and toxic mixture. Sounds of mass humanity bounce 
upon the ground and walls which surround the area, denoting everything from the 
moanful cries of a lovers passion to the sharp screams of pain discovered by 
those who venture down the wrong path. Jerry-rigged electrical wires and leaky 
water lines criss-cross between dwellings overhead as the residents within 
attempt to illegitimately pry away valuable resources for their own use. 
   Throughout the area people operate in close proximity to each other, with 
barely a shoulder's length worth of room by which to navigate as the goings on 
of every day life play out - children playing, merchants transporting their 
goods to the market, residents drying their clothes upon low-hanging power 
lines.

The Forges in the Market~
   The hustle and bustle diminishes here, as most Grungetownians 
stick to the perimeter of the marketplace, crowding near walls 
and down the occasional off-shoot alleyway. Instead of letting 
this free space go to waste, instead a series of forges, lathes, 
bellows and benches have been set up, a vibrant hub of Outland 
industry producing new weapons and wares from materials scavenged 
from the wastes. The trash on the ground is slightly less 
compacted, and collects in potholes and around low, deteriorating 
concrete stumps. Even in the relative calm, the murmur of the 
crowd is a constant drone, often punctuated by the hammering or 
quenching of metal.

The Edge of the Market~
   Interspersed unevenly around the marketplace is an occasional 
vendor, loudly hawking their wares to any that would listen, 
voices cut through and drowned out by other voices - more 
vendors, louder. The loudest of these is rewarded with more 
customers, most of them probably more annoyed than anything else, 
but wasting their time there, regardless. Trash is littered 
everywhere over the dirt road, kicked by the crowded traffic or 
otherwise pounded firmly into the dirt, providing a meager 
pavement.

Slums Before a Western Gateway (West Harlan Street and Santa Tedosia Road)~
   The clamor of humanity resounds with unrestrained ferocity along this 
makeshift roadway, curving from the east to the south, as the residents of the 
neighborhood go about their business - living, dying, playing, crying, and 
(attempting) to survive. A section of the shanty-town has been marred by 
burn-marks, telling of an aspiring cooks efforts gone awry as the residents 
have wasted no time rebuilding the area with newly constructed shanties and 
lean-tos connected by an intricate system of ladders, ropes and ramps. Smoke 
hangs heavily in the area, its origins seemingly mixed within industry and 
residence as toxic fumes mingle with the odors associated with mass-humanity 
crammed together in nearly unlivable conditions. An iron gateway has been set 
into the western walls here, the surrounding slums nearly teeter-tottering over 
the top as #2a small metal sign#0 warns any who may consider leaving the 
relative 'comfort' of the slums. A small and all-too-rare pathway leads deeper 
into the slums to the north.

Auction Stalls Set Within Slums (West Harlan Street)~
   The aromas and sounds of people from all walks of life mingles together here 
amidst the maze-like splintering of paths which splits off from the main 
thoroughfare heading both east and west, the web-like paths twisting betwixt 
stalls hastily constructed in the midst of slum shacks and shanties stacked so 
high it seems, at times, they may topple. A multi-story complx rises to the 
east, constructed of slowly-disintegrating polycrete, though only its northern 
wall is visible from here. The stalls themselves house all manner of auctions, 
merchants both foreign and domestic in origin hawking wares as diverse as they 
themselves are found to be. Plastic tarpaulins shelter their goods from the 
elements as slum-children can be seen sneaking about, ocassionally picking off 
a vulnerable item or two to support their own entrepreneurial endeavors.

A Chaotic Central Plaza (Oil Road and Harlan Street)~
   Growing to an utterly chaotic pace, the pedestrian traffic through this busy 
intersection is accompanied by the bittersweet smell of body odor and all of 
the associated qualities of mass-humanity. The pathways continue in all four 
cardinal directions, with those seeking their routes leaving little in the way 
of room to adjust as they go about their business. Voices grow ever-louder 
here, as those attempting to speak find themselves competing against those they 
bump shoulders with - the result being a symphony of shouts and whoops combined 
with the all-too-close clamor of machinery, music, and all manner of things 
which seek to assault those more sensitive in their auditory capacities. Life 
is at its most abundant here, with people from all walks of life seemingly 
mixed into what could be aptly described as a cesspool of humanity - musicians 
play their songs and dancers dance, merchants transport their wares and small 
children pick through the crowd, perhaps coming away with a chip or two. In 
the midst of it all a small clearing has been enforced at the center of the 
intersection by #2a tall, electrified chainlink fence#0 which surrounds #2a 
flagpole bearing a massive black flag with#0 #1a red 'W'#0 #2in its center#0.

Currently, #2a massive, black flag marked in the center with#0

Auction Stalls Before an Apartment Building (East Harlan Street)~
   Street performers mix within the crowds which attend and seek out the 
auction stalls here, putting their talent (or lack thereof) on display as they 
juggle, dance, and consume unconsumable substances in the hopes of a stranger 
taking pity upon them with a spare chip or a bit of food. Merchants pay no 
mind to anything but their business as they call out unceasingly to passers-by, 
looking for bids to the benefit of their 'next big thing' - whatever that item 
may indeed be, from scavenged paper clips to finely-crafted weaponry. A squat, 
three-story building has risen from the slums to the south, constructed of 
dingy polycrete which has been chipped away in certain places to expose the 
metal framework beneath. #2A large, elegantly inscribed sign#0 hangs from a 
single remaining bolt next to its doorway which is flanked by guards. From 
here the thoroughfare continues to snake both west, towards the cacophany of 
the central plaza and east, further into the dense slums which dominate life 
here.

Slums Settled Before an Eastern Gateway (East Harlan St. and Jawahar Way)~
   Unwashed beggars and street urchins, some missing limbs or deformed in a 
major way, mingle with the passing crowds as they seek out charity in whatever 
form it may come, their cries of agony bouncing off of the high-stacked slum 
shanties which rise up on all sides. Smalls streams of waste and trash flow 
through cracks in the ground beneath, creating large, foul puddles which do 
little to interrupt the flow of pedestrian traffic in the area. The path 
through the slums curves here, continuing both west and south. Rats and the 
occassional lizard move underfoot, seizing upon even the smallest morsel of 
nutrition before dragging it back away into the sewer reliefs scattered 
dangerously underfoot. An iron gateway rises up to the east, #2a small, metal

seek to leave the 'comfort' of the slums for the turfs.

Slums Inundated by Smoke (Santa Tedosia Road)~
   A heavy smoke, acrid and reeking of burnt plastic among other things, has 
settled over the nearby area as if it were a rightful resident all in and of 
its own. This does seemingly little to dissuade residents away from the area 
though, as the slums here are as thick as anywhere else - with 
scrap-constructed shanties indeed set into the place directly up against the 
massive building from which the smoke emanates to the west. The resulting 
smokey haze casts a fog-like affect over the nearby area, the coughs of 
neighborhood residents and playing children ringing out incessantly in the 
background. Directly across from the factory-like building to the west sits a 
large complex constructed of slowly disintegrating poly-crete to the east, #2a 
large billboard#0 propped up directly outside its entranceway by jerry-rigged 
plastic and metal supports. 

A heavy throng of traffic passes through two massive doors to the west that 
lead into an equally massive building. Upon the door is painted a crude 
lizard, spitting a flame that takes up the majority of the door. Done in 
watercolors, it gives the illusion that the door is melting.

Amidst Merchant Stalls (South Oil Road)~
   Stalls ranging from the pitifully inadequate to the oddly impressive crowd 
in upon this section of road with runs north and south upon what seems to be a 
jagged, almost random route. Crudely fashions wheelbarrows and wagons drag in 
supplies and merchandise from caravans which have brought their wares for trade 
and sale. Harsh voices arguing prices and the quality of goods are 
intermingled with the lilting and well-practiced intonations of experienced 
merchants, quick with a smile and a deal. Aromas both foreign and domestic 
waft through the air, offering temporary, though sadly incomplete, relief from 
the usually overpowering scent of human refuse dominant in the slums.

A Run-Down, Dingy Lobby~
   A high-arched doorway composed of peeling faux-woood serves as the entrance 
to the north, its features marred with scratches indicative of heavy use and 
poor maintenance. The floor beneath is carpeted in a dingy red shag, faded and 
worn nearly bald in spots as the polycrete below is visible in certain spots 
while others have been hastily patched over with scrap cloth and tape. An 
aroma of cigarettes and sex lingers in the stale air here which carries with it 
the sounds of the slums to the north, the buildings walls doing little to hold 
back the uproarious commotion from outside. This area seems to serve as a 
lobby of sorts, with patrons lingering within, occassionally chatting to one 
another or resting in one of the couches seemingly randomly scattered 
throughout. #2Various posters#0 of Wilmingtons engaging in good deeds adorn 
the walls, while a large, faux-wood desk takes up the majority of the southern 
wall as patrons come and go, checking in and out at the counter behind which 
#2a large, tattered black flag with#0 #1a red 'W'#0 in its center is nailed at 
full-length into the walls.

Amidst Rotten-Smelling Slums (Jawahar Way)~
   The aroma of rotting produce and organic matter hangs thickly in the air 
here, made all the worse by a thin film of grime which seems to coat everything 
nearby. The shanties in this area have been constructed, in large part, of 
plastic tarpaulins set within pieces of rubble and stone stacked atop each 
other and braced by haphazard supports of opportunity. Ramps and bridges allow 
access into the upper reaches of the shanty-town while the constant clamor of 
voices, acts of passion, violence and daily activity within makes evident the 
plethora of life abound within the dank depths of this ghetto. The path which 
acts as the main thoroughfare through this neighborhood maneuvers through the 
shanty town in gradual curves and abrupt turn-abouts, culminating in the 
allowance of passage from north to south - an opportunity taken care of by 
throngs of people pushing their way through the area. 

A pair of massive double doors lead to a warehouse to the east, through which a 
heavy flow of traffic moves. Adorning these doors is a painting: a giant 
lizard is eating a bunch of what looks like organic material - a pile of greens 
and reds, hunks of plants and animals.

Before the Municipal Center (Santa Tedosia Road and Cowley Ave.)~
   The constant screeching of metal being twisted, torn and mashed hails from 
the massive building to the west, a thin layer of acrid smoke serving as the 
cause of a mist-like affect which seems to hover over the immediate area. 
Electrical wires bound and connected by duct tape and thin strips of whatever 
material can bind them criss-cross overhead, an incessant buzzing sound 
emanating from within as the throngs of pedestrian traffic move beneath them, 
dodging the occassional fallen live wire. The trash-lined road curves from 
north to east here, small streams of fluid and refuse flowing into the 
occassionally clogged sewer drains which have been hastily pitted out upon the 
sides of the thoroughfare, doing little to relieve the always-present smell of 
mass-humanity. 

To the west a pair of massive double doors lead into a warehouse, through which 
heavy traffic pours. Upon the doors has been painted a crude lizard in the act 
of ripping up chunks of metal and shoving them into its flame-filled maw. To 
the south a relatively glamorous three-story building rises up behind a large 
metal gateway set before a courtyard, the building itself sticking out like a 
sore-thumb as its well-maintained grounds stand at odds with the rest of the 
surrounding area. #2A large, titon-alloy sign#0 has been bolted into the wall 
next to the well-guarded southern gate.

Outside of the Arena (West Cowley Avenue)~
   A cacophany of activity is ever-present in this neighborhood, set directly 
across from a large warehouse to the south which seems to be constantly abuzz 
with movement and shouts. Street performers wander and dance about the streets 
as beggars and pickpockets mingle with the crowds assembled nearby. The slum 
residences of the area, given modicum of privacy only by small strips of cloth 
of plastic which hang over their entryways, have been connected in somewhat 
ingenious fashion by long rope-bridges which hang amidst an intricate web of 
electrical wires and water pipes overhead, the source of the occassional 
splatter of human waste onto the streets below as they relieve themselves of 
both the burden and the smell while forcing it, sometimes in quite grotesque 
fashion, upon the unsuspecting bystanders below. 

Southwards stands a large, old warehouse, with a crude picture painted across 
the inwards-opening doors. The picture is that of two warriors, one red and 
one blue, battling to the death. While crude, the painter has obviously taken 
great care into the upkeep of the picture - amidst a swath of graffiti and 
dirt, the painting remains relatively untouched.

Slums Before the Southern Gates (Oil Road and Cowley Ave.)~
   Loose-hanging electrical wires create a tangled, buzzing mess of black 
overhead as similarly jerry-rigged water lines allow droplets of water to muddy 
the ground beneath as their duct tabs and chicken wire bindings fail to keep 
them watertight. The intimately personal goings-on of those who take residence 
in the surrounding slums become quickly obvious to all as their paper-thin 
scrap-metal shelters offer little in the way of privacy, with everything from 
lustful cries of passion to gut-wrenching fecal discharges beind audible and, 
at times, visible to anyone who may care. Trash and fecal matter mixed with 
urine litters the street beneath, creating an everflowing stream of 'muddy 
waters' which is relieved only by the ocassional, and often clogged, sewer 
drain leading into the undoubtedly evermore horrific depths of the slum's own 
bowels. An intersection allowing passage in all four cardinal directions forms 
here before massive gates which allow passage to what passers by affectionately 
refer to as 'the Grunge', #2a small sign#0 being all the warning offered to 
those venturing outside. 

To the south is a battered, but strong, iron gate. You realize you must #6CALL 
GATEGUARD#0 to proceed any further.

Raucous Neighborhood Outside of the Doghouse (East Cowley Ave.)~
   A backed up and broken sewer line has punched up through the ground 
underfoot, leaving a puddle of black water and all manner of foulness 
surrounding it despite the fact that it has long since been turned off, or its 
root system made non-functional. Pedestrian traffic plods through the area 
nonetheless, wading occasionally through knee-deep muck to get to their various 
destinations. Children play along the murky shores of the pool with makeshift 
boats which they set across its waters to see which one makes it furthest. The 
slums rise high overhead here, cat calls and shouts regularly audible amidst 
the cacophany and chaos of the nearby area. The neighborhood takes on a 
particularly festive mood - with drunkards and others of ill-repute stumbling 
along the thoroughfare to the very best of their abilities. 

The building to the south is fairly lively, with all sorts of raucous noise and 
people spilling out, adding to the bustling traffic.

Zig-Zagging Slums Before a Firebreather (South Jawahar Way and East Cowley Ave.)~
   The thoroughfare through the dense, inter-woven slums of this neighbohood 
zigzags to and fro before eventually sweeping from west to north - masses of 
people pushing their way forth amidst unending, unwashed waves of humanity. 
Heavy churning sounds constantly emanate from the massive, factory-like 
building to the east which layers of slum-dwellings have been built upon, 
constructed of little more than scrap-metal and bits of cloth of plastic to act 
as barriers against the ghetto beyond. An web of electrical wires and water 
lines, both haphazard and intricate at the same time, run overhead as residents 
try (and usually fail) to acquire the most basic of utilities in support of 
their unending quest for survival. 
   A pair of massive double doors lead to a warehouse to the east, through 
which a heavy flow of traffic moves. Adorning these doors is a painting: a 
giant lizard setting a shirt on fire. 
   A sign has been hung above a ladder that leads down a maintenance shaft in 
one corner of the slums, #2"Tunnels"#0 written on it crudely in thick green 
paint.

   Set firmly onto the edge of the market square, this warehouse 
stretches out long and wide, allowing a large number of people to 
crowd in at the same time - participants, spectators, and other 
traffic that flows from the marketplace, all filtering through 
the warhouse-turned-arena. Contrary to the look on the outside, 
this warehouse is fairly well-constructed, with sturdy walls and 
support beams and actually intact windows, here and there. The 
floors are covered in all manner of trash and the walls are 
scratched and marred, giving the place an altogether messy 
appearance. 
   Amidst the semi-controlled chaos is a betting booth, situated 
on the western wall, near the hallway that leads onwards. A 
golden coin is painted onto the wall above it, so as to prevent 
confusion. Southwards stretches another hallway.

floor of wired steel mesh, it is created for a single sole 
purpose: Entertainment. While wide, the amount of people that 
cram into this room can make it seem particularly crowded, and 
the mesh floor often buckles dangerously beneath the weight of

Some larger pipes and massive pistons have worn markings of the 
old civilization on them, while many others seem refurbished and 
replaced over time, remolded from polyprop plastic or hammered 
iron alloys. The air smells of rust and pipe-fitting grease and 
the air feels consistently damp. The crushed-remains of ruined 
barrels litter the area, as a massive robotic crane moves back 
and forth on tracks above, scanning the floor.

   A square utility chamber, this room is filled with archaic 
pipes from the original pumpworks snaking in and out of the 
concrete walls. A confusing maze of refurbished pipes drips 
slightly, leaving a constantly damp feeling in the air. An 
oppressive concrete slab makes up the roof above, a corroded old 
titanium ladder bolted from a hatch above to the floor below.

around it refurbished by the sprawling settlements built in each

   This room is completely silent, all the machinery within cold 
and unmoving. Wires of all sizes cover this room, from small 
colored wires wrapped in bundles that snake across the ceiling to 
giant cables that crawl across the ground. The majority of them 
connect to the generator in the center of the room, which sits 
just as lifeless as any of the other panels or machines in here. 
There is quite a bit of free room, but most of it is taken up by 
those wires.

   This station was once quite large, but all that is still 
standing are the southern and western walls, which barely hold a 
portion of the roof up between them. Everywhere else, the roof 
and walls have fallen in. Poking out of the rubble of the fallen 
structure are wires: yards and yards of ruined, burnt wires, as 
well as a destroyed pair of pylons. A fallen staircase clings to 
the wall, rendered impassable, though it's not as if there's 
anything overhead to climb up to.

electric cables wind throughout the room then disappear into 
narrow conduits that run below adjacent buildings, making this a 
central node. A substation fills the center of the room, 
dividing out the power from the larger cables to the smaller 
building-sized wires. A set of stairs is built against the north 
wall, leading to a trapdoor above.

   A dull humming noise permeates this room, emanating from the 
large amounts of electrical equipment that line the walls. The 
equipment takes up nearly all the available space - wires can be 
seen snaking out between monitors or consoles, wiggled around 
machinery so as to be plugged into the outlets set within the 
wall. The constant presence of the large, humming machinery 
makes this room cramped and hot, with each added person only 
making it exponentially more cramped and hotter.

snake across the ceiling to giant cables that crawl across the 
ground. the majority of them connect to the generator in the 
center of the room, which emits a harsh blue glow that gives the 
room an eerie hue. There is quite a bit of room in here, but 
most of it is taken up by those wires.

A Large Electrical Relay~
   This station is quite large, needing quite a bit of room to 
house the equipment held within. It seems that most of that 
equipment is wires - the roof is absolutely covered in wires of 
all colors, stretching this way and that, held up by metal beams. 
These wires run to (and from) a series of pylons that stand in 
the center of the room, producing a dull hum. A winding stairway 
encircles the entire room, leading up and up the tower. 
   Beside the southern door is a hand-sized biometic scanner.

Outside a Destroyed Establishment (West Baseline Avenue)~
Burning trash piles set within small communal alcoves cause toxic smoke to rise and then hang 
statically among the stacked slum residences which house a mishmash of people, metal and despair. 
Allowing for only the barest of existences, they loom over the winding path leading towards an iron 
gateway to the west. #3A small metal sign#0 is bolted nearby. Street vendors hawk their wares with a 
fervor from hastily prepared positions consisting, more often than not, only a piece of loose 
plastic or metal laid bare upon the ground for them to display their goods. A once impressive golden 
domed building to the north now lies in ruins, one half crushed into rubble. Entry is barred by the 
destruction, the entire lobby and front door buried under debris.


To the west is a battered, but strong, iron gate. You realize you must #6CALL#0 the 
#6GATEGUARD#0 to proceed any further.

A Derelict Sewer Tunnel~
   This narrow tunnel is made tighter by the fact that it is 
halfway collapsed upon itself - stone clots up most of the room, 
and makes traveling through nearly impossible. Caved in walls 
block most paths of eggression, offering little more than a 
strict, linear path. Evidence that this was once a sewer stains 
the walls in browns and blacks; now, however, it is completely

A Narrow Crossroads~
   The tunnels here get slightly wider - but not very much. 
Concrete support columns have kept this section of tunnel from 
collapsing as badly as the rest, and a relatively small amount of 
debris litters the ground. Noticeable here is the gulley through 
which raw sewage once ran, now empty but for thick stains. 
Branching off from this vague crossroads, to the major cardinal 
directions, are tunnels, these less structurally intact.

strict, linear path. Evidence that this was once a sewer stains 
the walls in browns and blacks; now, however, it is completely 
dry and stenchless.

An Old, Abandoned Tunnel~
   This narrow tunnel is made tighter by the fact that it is 
halfway collapsed upon itself - stone clots up most of the room,

Northern Gatehouse Surveillance Room~
   This room sits pretty securely inside the Perimeter wall. It 
is small, somewhat cramped, and fairly blank - the sheet metal 
and concrete combination that make up the walls, floor, and 
ceiling have absolutely no decoration. Along the northern wall 
is a bank of crude consoles; a handful of television screens are 
set into these metal hunks, and a few buttons line the tops of 
the bent metal. Thick wires are bound with more wires, running 
this way and that before disappearing into the floor.

Atop the Northern Perimeter~
   The top of the Perimeter allows a fine view - the monotonous 
gray of the moonscape stretches out beyond, and the ramshackle 
shanties of Grungetown lie behind. Forty feet tall if it is an 
inch, the most protection from falling offered is a flimsy, 
waist-high guard rail. A walkway made of riveted, rusty sheet 
metal lines the path between the rails.

Atop the Eastern Perimeter~
   The top of the Perimeter allows a fine view - the monotonous 
gray of the moonscape stretches out beyond, and the ramshackle 
shanties of Grungetown lie behind. Forty feet tall if it is an 
inch, the most protection from falling offered is a flimsy, 
waist-high guard rail. A walkway made of riveted, rusty sheet 
metal lines the path between the rails.

Surveillance Room~
   This room sits pretty securely inside the Perimeter wall. It 
is small, somewhat cramped, and fairly blank - the sheet metal 
and concrete combination that make up the walls, floor, and 
ceiling have absolutely no decoration. Along the northern wall 
is a bank of crude consoles; a handful of television screens are 
set into these metal hunks, and a few buttons line the tops of 
the bent metal. Thick wires are bound with more wires, running 
this way and that before disappearing into the floor.

it drops off fiercely south, into the lake.

shanties of Grungetown lie behind. Forty feet tall if it is an 
inch, the most protection from falling offered is a flimsy, 
waist-high guard rail. A walkway made of riveted, rusty sheet 
metal lines the path between the rails.

A Narrow Alleyway~
   Rusted and battered sheet metal walls loom inwards towards 
this small alley, making it difficult for more than two to stand 
abreast within it and bottlenecking all travel to a single file 
line. The ground is almost entirely bereft of paving, the little 
bit of concrete left no more than a pitted, hardpacked crust. 
The alley continues on to the east, snaking it's way between the 
layers of ruined structures.

Along a Narrow Alleyway, Near a Ruined Shack~
   The alley opens up slightly here, cutting deeper into the 
ruins to the east. A rundown building to the north stands firm 
amongst the husks and collapsed forms of neighboring structures, 
it's windows long ago boarded over with pieces of worn plastic 
and bits of dented metal. A few dusty weeds struggle in the 
hardpacked dirt, forming gnarled root structures near the 
foundations of buildings and between the sparse stretches of 
paving, splitting it even further apart.

   The patchwork, metal roofing of the shack slants downwards to 
the south, forming a slight incline and ridge to the north, 
running up against and being overlapped by the similarly slanting 
roof of an adjacent structure to the east. To the north, the 
street below runs east towards the innercity and west towards the 
eastern gates of the city.

A Sharp Turn In the Alley~
   The alley stops abruptly to the east as it runs up against a 
tangled mass of collapsed buildings and curves sharply to the 
south, coursing between the layers of yet more dilapidated 
buildings. The paving appears less worn here, with fewer 
sections missing, though a few scraggly weeds run along the 
insides of the cracked concrete and along its edges, little more 
than leafless stems and roots.

Deep in the Ruins, Near an Abandoned Shop~
   Collapsed walls and supports of adjacent buildings lean 
inwards along the cramped path, forming an open, impromptu tunnel 
of twisted metal above. To the south further travel is hindered 
by what appears to be an old, windowless, shop of some fashion, a 
faded billboard depicting a pair of crossed rifles. The outside 
is weather-beaten, rust and bullet hole patterns scattered along 
its front.

East of a Decrepit Shop~
   The alley stretches east to south here, snaking a rough path 
amongst the rubble. A layer of ruined structures, and beyond 
that, the Perimeter create an impassable maze to the east, 
blocking any further travel in that direction. To the south, the 
silhoutte of a large building stands against a backdrop of chaos 
and destruction.

horizontal row of rectangular windows begin at the southeastern

the concrete facing above them faded beyond recognition. The 
dirt and somewhat paved path continue on to the east.

left wing of the warehouse to the southeast. The walls long ago 
destroyed, only the thick metal frame remains, a skeleton of its 
former glory. The space beneath is bordered on all sides by the 
prevalent masses of layered buildings and tangled mazes of 
skeletal ruins, blocking all travel north, south, and west.

A Cramped, Abandoned Shophouse~
   Soot and burn marks coat the interior of this small storeroom, 
the metal walls beneath ripple outward and, in some places, are 
melted into a smooth slag. The flooring caves down to the dirt 
beneath near the eastern wall, slanting towards a large, 
jagged-edged hole that takes up the majority of the eastern wall 
and ceiling.

In a Narrow Pocket Between Buildings~
   At one point in time, this space might have been big enough 
for one person to squeeze through. Now it's more flat and open, 
but rubble has tumbled down from above, choking the walkways and 
forcing any passing through to go up, over, and along ever 
shifting debris. To the east, there is another portion that is 
wider - but not much clearer.

A Half-Buried Dead-End~
   This space ends abruptly at a partially collapsed polycrete 
wall. It is littered with cracks, and the occasional chunk of 
material falls off in a shower of dust. Still more dust drifts 
down from above, dropping onto the piles of destroyed building in 
the narrow space below. It is possible to trek across the rubble 
to the west, or to perhaps widen out this space to make it 
usable.

A Bare, Concrete Hallway~
   This is a bare concrete hallway that runs off to the west, in 
relatively decent shape to the ruin outside, barring the missing 
door and the collapsed stair case. Within all is silent and 
dark, but further to the west large shapes can be seen in the 
darkness. No attempt at ornamentation has been made.

A Bare, Concrete Hallway~
   This hallway is all poured gray concrete and dim light-lamps, 
running from east to west. A narrow stairway leads up in the 
northern wall, and a door with banded chrion alloy is set in the 
west. The faint rush of water and popping and pinging is heard. 
   The reinforced door to the west is installed with a biometric 
scanner, and you realize you can #6HANDSCAN WEST#0 with proper

abreast at best. Wire-mesh and railing encircles it for safety. 
Not too far below, a grimy street is visible.

   What once was a small, relatively quiet and peaceful place is 
now a smoking remains of the buildings that once loomed around

relentless with its wafting stench of burnt plastic and 
tarnished, fire-eaten metal.

Trapped Within a Metal and Glass Prison~
   This claustrophobic room is encased in metal and glass. It is 
numbingly cold here and strange gas fogs the stale air. Tubes 
jut out of the walls, some hanging limply and some broken

some sort of metal-plastic alloy. At the front of the chamber is 
a glass hatch with a number inscribed upon its sleek surface. 
Beyond that lay only darkness.

A Dim, Littered Foyer~
   This modest theatre foyer has been built from concrete, its 
walls splashed with a crimson red paint. A high ceiling is 
scattered with dozens of small white bulbs which cast only a dim, 
weak light onto the surroundings below. The walls have been hung 
with a wide selection of modern paintings and range in both size 
and subject: one large painting on the west wall depicts a 
portrait of a man with windswept blond hair, blue eyes and pearly 
white teeth. A number of other smaller paintings depict various 
scenes of Grungetown from an image that captures the Market Place 
at its busiest to a painting of a lone female patron at the 
Doghouse Bar.

A Dingy Red Corridor~
   Wide enough to fit three or four people abreast, this dingy 
corridor is somewhat cramped and stuffy. The concrete walls have 
been poorly painted with a crimson red wash and there are visible 
cracks and marrs on their surface. Three yellowing glass 
chandeliers are affixed to the low ceiling, the plaster cracking 
under their weight. The chandeliers cast a dull white light on a 
number of wall-paintings, the biggest of which stretches nearly 
half of the western wall, depicting a "nature" scene in the wilds 
outside Grungetown - a Lagato seems to be sniffing an old boot 
near a pock-marked boulder and in the distance a lone Coyote lies 
in the shade under a crumbling building.

A Domed, Dingy Theatre with Red Lighting~
   Compared to the cramped, stuffy corridor to the south, this 
open theatre is a breath of fresh air. Its tall, domed form is 
bathed in a dull red light, cast by hundreds of small red bulbs 
encased in red plastic shades along the walls and floor. The 
floor itself has been carpeted - also in red - and bears obvious 
signs of its age where it is starting to come up from the 
floorboards around the skirting. High up, the ceiling itself is 
also in disrepair, the thin grey tiles - only partially visible 
in the weak red light - have fallen off in places leaving obvious 
black gaps to the concrete skeleton of the theatre. At the very 
back of the theatre, the opposite side to the corridor to the 
south, a large concrete stage stretches out the entire length of 
the theatre, its surface splashed with a light brown paint. The 
decor is somewhat antiquated: tiers upon tiers of velour seats 
stretch in a semi-circle fashion around the stage, seemingly 
un-oiled for some time by the sounds of it, and broad, plain 
patterns of gold decorate the walls.

A Cramped Side-Wing of the Theatre~
   When the theatre is at full capacity the sounds through to the 
east are most often the quiet murmur and chatter of the audience 
or the loud cheers, jeers and the clapping of hands. The walls 
here have, like most of the theatre, been splashed with a crimson 
red paint and only a solitary lightbulb hanging from the ceiling 
on a cord gives light.

A Costume and Prop-Cluttered Room~
   A myriad of cast-iron trolleys line the walls of this dingy, 
cluttered room, home to some several hundred costumes, props and 
a manner of all sorts else. The room itself is long and thin, 
stretching from north to south, its concrete walls splashed with 
a crimson paint. There is little space for movement between the 
rows and rows of trolleys either side of the walls and what space 
there is between them is usually cluttered with discarded 
costumes which gather dust. A yellowing chandelier hangs from 
the centre of the room, its light obscured mostly by the clutter 
here.

A Cluttered Backstage Area~
   This area is very limited in space due to the much larger 
props such as murals and large scenery paintings which have been 
left here against the walls, meaning that people have to shuffle 
past each other to get from one wing to the other. The din of 
the audience can be heard now, only just beyond the props which 
shelter this area from the main theatre space and stage. Several 
costumes of an earlier day have been hung around on various 
cracks in the bleak grey concrete walls as well as on the floor, 
cluttering the area even more.

High Rows of Velour-Covered Theatre Seats~
   The seats here - scarred with teeth marks, cigarette burns and 
chewing gum - have been covered in soft red velour, contributing 
to the overly dingy red glow which this theatre has been bathed 
in. A couple of small lightbulbs, housed in translucent red 
shades, line the crimson-splashed walls at the end of the rows. 
The stage seems to be somewhat far away from such a height and so 
far back in the theatre but you can at least see the performance.

Inside a Crumbling Shanty~
   This shanty has long gone unused, its walls and floor severely 
cracked and crumbling. All manner of refuse from soiled polymer 
clothing to plastic bags and cans line its edges. A corrugated 
iron roof sits precariously atop the walls, fastened in place 
with rusting metal brackets and a messy assortment of wires. In 
the near centre of the establishment sits a rusty iron grate, 
circular in shape, giving access to a damp, dark room below.

A Damp, Cold Cellar~
   The constant dripping of cracked, forgotten water pipes breaks 
the dead silence of this cold underground cellar. At several 
points around the edge of the room puddles of dirty water have 
accumulated and, in some areas, the dripping water has eroded 
into the broken concrete underfoot. For the most part the cellar 
floor has been covered unevenly with concrete and is cracked and 
broken in places. Every now and then one might hear the shuffle 
of footsteps or voices above through the rusted grate.

A Factory Lobby~
   The incessant hum of machinery, of all shapes and sizes, is somewhat dulled 
by thick chrion walls, but nevertheless fills this spacious lobby, mingling 
with the occasional hawker's cry from outdoors. A steady trickle of 
work-stained laborers pass through, wielding plastic cards which admit them 
access through the various electronically-locked doors in the hallway to the 
west. Along the wall opposite the entrance is a broad, sweeping counter, 
stretching from one wall to the other, and constantly manned by factory 
attendants, a thick magnon-door with a hand-scanner barring most entry.

Armorcrafting Wing~
   This somewhat cramped, and recently renovated, factory floor is a rather 
literal sweat shop, the furnaces rendering the room unbearable for any 
significant stretch of time. Most of the equipment is in constant use, the 
mechanical whirr of spinnerets filling the air, alongside the sharp clang of 
heated metal plates being hammered into shape. Scraps of polymesh and 
shattered plastic litter the floors, sweeped up occasionally by factory staff 
to be rebreathed. A few workbenches allow the more delicate assembly of 
armors, all grease-stained and otherwise mucked by previous works.

Weaponcrafting Wing~
   Lined with opposing rows of workbenches, and hotter than Lunar day, this 
narrowed room is constantly filled with the clanging of hammers to metal. 
Likely once a factory corridor, it has been renovated into a workshop. A pair 
of furnaces rest at the far wall, the heat that issues forth from them pouring 
out over the rest of the room in intolerable waves, the only relief a wide hole 
in the ceiling above them. Far opposite from the worst of the heat, and rather 
near to the main entrance, are the lathes which allow the more precision work 
required by a Weaponcrafter's trade. Almost always busy, there are generally 
only a few unoccupied workbenches.

Chemistry Wing~
   This laboratory seems wholly removed from the rest of the factory, likely 
due to its position underground. Its chrion walls are kept mostly cleaned of 
contaminants, and the machinery within closely monitored by white-coated 
factory staff. Being a Grungetown establishment, it is still dirty by most 
standards, bits of plant matter clinging in places it likely shouldn't, and the 
occasional chemical spill causing brief alarm. Nevertheless, the noise in here 
is subdued compared to the rest of the rehabilitated factory, the subdued hum 
and whine of chemical machinery. A cabinet of vials and tubes is clearly 
labeled "for public consumption", and is seemingly often raided.

End of the Hallway~
   The hallway stretches on to an abrupt dead-end, a pair of doors sitting 
opposite each other in the middle of the narrow corridor. Both are locked in 
the same manner as the ones closer to the lobby, one being of simple plastic 
and the other an imposing slab of solid magnon. You could likely use an access 
card to #6SWIPE NORTH#0 or #6SOUTH#0.

Gunsmithing Wing~
   The mixture of potential explosives and firearms renders this room the most 
secured of all in the Factory, constantly guarded by kevlar-clad enforcers. 
The equipment is sparse, and lines often form for their usage, from the 
singular forge to a pair of often-refurbished bullet presses. The only 
machinery in abundance is seemingly the lathes, which are in almost constant 
use, the occasional ear-shattering grind announcing a break-down. As opposed 
to the rest of the factory floors, this one's walls seem extra-thick, a few 
magnon plates providing reinforcement, and a few holes have dented and pierced 
the walls, signs of accidents hopefully long past.

A Burnt-Out, Partially Collapsed Building~
   The concrete walls of this building are blackened in most 
places, and only here or there does the true, dingy color of the 
old concrete show out. Rubble is strewn about: Pipes, huge hunks 
of plastic, and other sorts of trash are scattered about in 
mounds. Some pipes still hang from the high ceiling and jut out 
from the walls. To the west, the building has collapsed 
completely, rendering passage impossible. A not-too-stable 
platform made of thick plastic slabs is bolted into the walls, 
making a loft above.

here, overlooking the room below. The plastic is warped by heat 
on one edge, drooping down from the bolts holding it to the wall. 
It is rickety and creaks with each step. The position of the 
perch allows one to #6look#0 out the collasped #6western#0 side 
of the building, and a gaping hole in the eastern wall allows 
either a view or a quick exit to the street below.

A Dirty, Cramped Apartment~
   This cramped living space offers little in the way of comfort 
or glamor, its floors consisting of carpet worn so thin is has 
begun to tear in places while the air carries with in the 
constant smell of cigarettes and mysterious, unidentifiable odors 
of the unpleasant variety. What were once faux-wood panelled 
walls have begun to peel away, exposing the harsh, stained 
polycrete beneath. The ceiling overhead betrays the obvious 
signs of water damage, with the ocassional droplet leaking down 
onto the floor below. A small, open doorway to the north allows 
passage into the master bedroom while a polyplastic doorway to 
the left leads to the bathroom.

   The polycrete walls of this room seem to be in a state of slow 
decay, with several holes clawed out from within their surface by 
some unseen rodent of ill-repute. The sounds of neighbors 
clamoring about constantly fills this space, with every footstep 
and shout bursting in from the ceilings and floors, clanging off 
of the walls noisily. This room smells of sex and spilt liquor, 
with several stains upon the carpet alluding to the rough nights 
this space has previously seen.

bucket feeding into a large, polyplastic pipe directed towards 
the back of the building.

A Cramped, Metal-Topped Shanty~
   Rusted scrap sheet metal has been bound overhead and 
reinforced with metal slats, acting as both the roof for those in 
this residence and a floor for those who live overhead. Stained 
bits of cloth and patched together segments of plastic compose 
the walls of this cramped space, offering little in the way of 
comfort or amenity. The sounds of those who live in the shacks, 
leantos and shanties of the slums echoes in through the entryway, 
which is covered by little more than a sheet of plastic which 
cathes occassionally in the wind. An mixture of all manner of 
human odors hangs heavily in the air, providing not-so-subtle 
hints of the deplorable conditions in which those of this area 
live. To the north, a small curtain hangs over the entrance to 
the bedroom.

A Dirty, Cramped Bedroom Within a Shanty~
   The back room of this shanty backs up directly against another 
residence set behind it, the only barrier between the two being a 
thin sheet of metal supported by a few loosely bound plastic 
supports. Barely large enough for a mattress, the floor of this 
room is in constant shift as bugs crawl up from the shanties 
beneath and in through the walls as they seek out survival and 
meals of their own. Dirt and grime are set into the various 
niches and cracks of this space, the unavoidable result of poor 
maintenance and the conditions of the area in which this shelter 
was constructed.

Loading Docks~
   Bits of trash flit through this rubble-filled lot, catching 
occasionally upon the various bits of metal which pierce out 
awkwardly from the ground beneath, bent and twisted in unusual 
formations of seared metal. The lot itself is barren and largely 
devoid of traffic, save for the occassional transient picking 
through rubble piles or sleeping just off the eastern roadway. 
The occassional breeze carries the stifling scents and chaotic 
noise of mass humanity in from the nearby slums to the east, 
serving as a constant reminder of what lies just around the bend. 
An old, decrepit warehouse dominates the western half of the lot, 
its sheet-metal roof slowly rusting away in subservience to the 
elements while #2a faded plastic sign#0 bolted to a small doorway 
near its crumbling loading dock carries on the memory of the 
warehouse's former glory.

place itself between the floor below and those who would wish to test their

Within an Office Overlooking the Warehouse Floor~
   Deep red carpeting, well-padded and soft to the touch, covers the floor of 
this office, its space measuring about fifteen feet wide by twenty feet long. 
The walls have been painted a singular shade of deep black, the paint thick, 
with a slightly rough texture. Large, open windows pierce the northern and 
southern walls, allowing views of the warehouse below. A slender opening cuts 
through the southern edge of the western wall, allowing passage into the next 
room. All three portals are adorned with thick curtains of burgundy velvet 
polymesh. The southern wall holds a thick door made of high quality black 
polyprop and is kept secure by a hand scanner beside it. The room is lit by 
two recessed rows of high end lighting, which is controlled by a small dimmer 
switch set to the other side of the southern doorway. Small, neat power 
outlets have been spaced evenly along the walls, a few inches above the ground. 
All in all, this office has feel of newness, and elegance, not often seen in 
Grungetown.

A Psychedelically Painted Bathroom~
   The walls composing this room are polycrete sprayed over with a coat of 
vivid indigo paint. From ceiling to wall there is an illustrative mural in 
blacks and acid toned colors of vultures whose feathers psychedelically meld 
into dozens of knives. Where the row of toilets sits on the wall the blades 
congregate and appear to point out threateningly at their potential user. The 
mural even trails messily to the dreary blue painted floor where cheap 
polyplastic tiling has been set, with the occasional tile peeling upwards or 
missing altogether. Sheets of silky, natural-hued polymesh hang in rough 
curtains around the toilets, acting as stalls. The north-west corner of the 
industrial bathroom holds a large shower, sectioned off by a thin alion door.

A Makeshift Greenhouse~

which has been clumsily attached to the edge of the warehouse. 
Clear plastic panels layered atop one another allow the available 
light to enter within and heat the innards of this area. Slats 
of hard polyplastic have been set loosely atop the ground 
beneath, serving as a floor to reflect and disseminate the 
increased warmth of the room. The mounds of rubble which 
surround the warehouse are all the visual aesthetic provided to 
those who would care to enjoy an afternoon soaking up the view, 
the occassional bit of trash or the scurrying of rats providing 
ample entertainment for those who would wish for it.

Before a Ruined Factory~
   The area here has been scorched recently by fire, pieces of blackened 
sheet-metal strewn almost at random throughout. Jagged edges of metal jut out 
to greet any that pass through, while ahead rises the broken form of what was 
once one of the many factories that are scattered across Grungetown. Squat and 
dark, the outer shell of the factory is formed from what appears to be tacked 
together sheet metal. A great hole has been torn from the top of the factory, 
visible even from here, the edges of the metal around it looking bent and 
twisted. A small metal door has somehow survived the chaos, standing at the 
end of a path that twists through the shattered remains of the slums that once 
occupied this area. Above the door, #2a broken sign#0 hangs precariously.

An Open-Spaced Lounge In the Factory~
   This vast expanse of factory has been ravaged by whatever ripped through the 
roof, a nearly ten meter hole simply torn away above, revealing the sky. The 
shaggy, pale green carpeting is sun-bleached in the center, stretching out from 
wall to wall. A set of precarious steps against the eastern wall, leads up to 
a narrow catwalk, bolted securely to the sheet metal walls that borders the 
area. Knotted marks of welding materials and spots of grease left behind serve 
as signs of the machinery that once stood in silent witness. Intricate tribal 
symbols superimpose landscaped moonscape scenery across the sides, a rough 
industrial look coupled with something rustic and ancient dominating the room. 
Heavy chrion I-beams are visible in the ceiling structure at intervals, hinting

catwalk~
   Narrow and precarious looking above, a metal catwalk traces 
the perimeter wall of the factory, bolted securely at various 
intervals to the I-Beams that form the skeleton of the factory. 
The catwalk seems to stretch from above the eastern wing of the 
factory to the west, with a section branching off an heading 
north overhead, leading to a small structure that looks to be 
almost part of the ceiling. 
~
E
hole~
   High above the factory, a great section of the roof has been 
torn away, likely by some violent explosion. The sky above can 
be seen through the remaining I-Beams that pass over the hole, 
somehow having survived the catastrophe. Glinting occasionally 
in the light when it is bright can be seen what looks to be a 
several meter high glass structure through the hole.

Split in a Hallway~
   Tiny blue tiles separated by lines of white grout make up the walls, ceiling 
and floor of this narrow 'T' between the two rooms east and west, and the door 
to the south. Beside the entrance area to the west, is a #2small blue sign#0 
that bears a tiny pictograph upon it. A square-shaped rich green carpet has 
been placed in the middle, the edges frayed, but holding together. Along one 
wall is a corridor-like staircase, leading down below and past a heavy door. 
The door itself has a sign in bright red: #1Authorized Personnel Only#0. Below 
is #1an encircled sign that has a man-like figure#0 with a rectangle at his 
left shoulder.

A Storage Room with a Low Ceiling~
   This chamber looks to have been recently refurbished, the tiny blue tiles 
separated by lines of white grout that make up the walls distinctly out of 
place from the coarse deep green carpeting that has been installed throughout. 
Shelves look to have been installed along the eastern walls, creating a small, 
but adequate area for storage. Plumbing pipes and wires are revealed along the 
walls, small spigots present where facilities seem to have been disconnected. 
A simple #2biometric handscanner#0 has been installed next to the southern

   Separated by lines of white grout, the walls, ceiling and floor are set with 
tiny blue tiles. A rough polyplastic partition separates by gender the male 
and female sections of this changing room, small pictographs with arrows 
separating the sides. Overall, the room itself is about five meters long, 
bearing a long ceiling and walls that press in on any moving about. Chrion 
alloy stalls line the walls, two per side, with several white polyprop toilets 
standing within. #2some graffiti#0 has been spraypainted along the western

A Ransacked Entryway~
   Pieces of broken furniture have been piled up near the doorway, the walls 
riddled with holes and concussive cracks. Pieces of light green-painted 
polyprop litter the floor, and also shards from broken windows alongside the 
door. The entire area is just a mess, pieces of trash and detritus crackling 
ominously under footsteps. In the ceiling above is an opaque, square-shaped 
band surrounding a single panel of transparent, frosted green polyprop which 
allows a distorted look up into the room above. 
   Across the northern wall has been writ, in grimy red spraypaint; "#1Ours is 
not to question why, ours is but to do and die.#0"

Landing off of a Foyer~
   Sectioned off from the rest of the first floor, this room is dim and has an 
opaque-surrounded, transparent polyprop floor which allows a look at the metal 
framework of the building and the space below. A series of thick, transparent 
steps with texturing at the center lead down into the cellar. The walls have 
been painted a bland brown, and smeared with a reddish substance that almost 
blends in against the paint. Here and there are a few fingerprints from it.

Southern Half of a Spacious Living Room~
   Large and spacious, with metal beams supporting the ceiling overhead, this 
room's polyprop walls have been painted a pale green with golden accents. 
Underfoot, the floor is polycrete painted or mixed to be a dark, earthen brown. 
The clear edge of the "ceiling" ends in a tightly spiraled, see-through ramp 
with a textured center portion to allow for a better grip than the smooth 
plastic would give. Most of the room is littered with trash picked up from 
outside, and one wall bears handprints and smudged rust red blood, a gradually 
fading strip dragged across the floor. 
   Someone has painted, in dried blood and a shaky hand, the following message:

A Railed Landing at the Top of a Spiraling Ramp~
   Situated over the northern half of the expansive room below, this landing is 
made of polycrete and plastic overlaying a metal framework. The last is easy 
to tell, because the center portion of the floor is clear for both layers, 
offering a #6look#0 straight #6down#0. Even so, metal and polyprop rails line 
the edge, allowing a handhold, and follow the spiral of the ramp which is 
passage below. The strange floor continues off to the north to a far larger, 
sectioned off room, and to a door at the eastern end.

A Spacious, Formerly Private Bathroom~
   The most obvious thing about this white-painted room is that the floor is 
see through. A square border around the edges gives way to a frosted, 
transparent green panel of polyprop which allows a look past the metal 
framework, down into the entryway of the building. Along the western wall runs 
a forest green polycrete countertop, surrounding a metal sink and allowing a 
shelf at the front of a fairly large shower. The floor of the shower is 
slightly indented into that of the room, with a drain. Rotten food, pieces of 
trash, and old scrap clutters the area extensively and the entire room smells 
of the excrement which has poured from the clogged toilet or just been 
deposited on the floor. Most of it would seem old, as it is caked and largely 
dried. 
   It might be possible to #6look down#0 into the foyer where foulness isn't 
coating the clear floor.

Eastern Half of a Long, Rectangular Room~
   Stretching the northern face of the well-kept building is one long, 
rectangular room. The northern wall has been set with a series of pained 
windows with shutters and a control panel for adjustment of the light in the 
room. It's difficult to tell what this was once, as there is very little left. 
Pieces of furniture, some urine-soaked scraps of cloth that might have been a 
vagrant's bed in the northeastern corner. Along the southern wall, in between 
two doorways, stretches an impressionist cityscape mural: it is done with a 
flare of bright colors, and is more an ideal than anything realistic.

   A rather large crack runs through the structure's walls, alongside the 
powered shutters that control the light from a long, clear polyprop window in 
the northern wall. Some of the panes appear to have been pushed out, and the 
crack runs into the opaque polyprop floor underfoot. A hinged door in the 
southwestern corner leads off to a fairly spacious bathroom. Along the 
southern wall, in between two doorways, stretches an impressionist cityscape 
mural: it is done with a flare of bright colors, and is more an ideal than

   Unlike most of the rest of the house, this room's interior is completely 
opaque. Not only that, it is quite dark when the lights are off. A control 
box for electrical working, and the ability to hook in various utilities, 
stands silent. A layer of dust coats everything, easily disturbed and clogging

towards the north with a slant of the surface.

Dust coats the floor, though patterns in it would suggest it has been disturbed

could be identified as humanoid. The walls are a blank, dark brown but the 
northern one has been painted with a mural showing a rooftop view of a decrepit 
town made of shanties and sturdier buildings, looking towards a steel wall far 
in the distance.

An Oblong, Earthy-Smelling Room~
   The corners of this room have been rounded off, making it more of an oblong 
shape. In the western wall has been set a clear, sliding glass door with an 
airtight seal. Humidity hangs in the air, and though very faint it is 
noticable, along with the scent of plantlife and earth. Sitting in dried out 
troughs are a number of dead and crumbling brown plants, hanging over the sides 
of their containers. At the northwestern corner rests a defunct water 
purifier, with a number of lines running from it. 
   Smeared on the wall with sweeping marks, in dried blood, is the message:

   The air in this room is thick with dust, which dances in front of any light

centralized units positioned in various parts of the medium-sized but cramped 
room. It is completely silent, no hum or slosh from functioning machinery 
present. A control panel is set off against one wall, with the screen smeared 
with a rust red substance. 
   The smudges of blood spell out a message: 



   #1One bright day it was dark as night, 
   Two dead boys got up to fight. 
   Back to back they faced each other, 
   Drew their swords and shot each other. 
   A deaf policeman heard the noise,

as a retro-looking wide-frequency radio. Dingy red carpeting covers stairs

The main room of this establishment lies southward, veiled by a golden-tassled 
curtain, while a bunk room is situated westward.

markings have been ripped off, replaced with crude strips of polymesh nailed 
into the plastic with labels. The floorboards bear numerous cracks, though the 
landing appears overall structurally sound. The red painted walls are peeling 
in places, and their faded quality gives the area a somber tone. Large metal 
double-doors lead up into what appears to be a glass-canopied greenhouse.

with overlapping dull-hued rugs, a hint of black showing occasionally in the 
mishmash. A mural of a lush garden takes up the southern wall, dramatic and 
vibrant while the rest of the space is dull and quiet. A scene of a 
flourishing hot-house bursting with all manner of flowers has been done in

Bleeding through the thin layer of blue paint are whimsical silhouettes of

of red carpeting, that does well to hide the numerous imperfections. Two more 
private antechambers flank either side of the hallway, their numbers etched 
into tarnished, old metal placards, while at the end of a hall is a long, 
darkly stained door that reads, if one is literate, 'Master Room'.

faint odor of chemicals in the air, the small narrow window on the eastern wall 
providing a poor excuse of ventilation and only a slivers of light to enter 
during the day. A rough, grey circular rug has been unrolled over the floor, 
worn and threadbare in some places. A couple of lewd posters featuring 
scantily-clad women have been posted up along the walls, though the most

tall polyprop frame rises around the area; thick but clear plastic sits in the 
grid-like panes, allowing light to shine through.

Cylindrical Room Beneath a Pipe~
   Shaped like a vertical cylinder, this room is fairly wide. At 
the center is a metal ladder with textured rungs, leading up to a 
much narrower hole in the ceiling of the room. The air inside is 
dank and smells like the sewers, though it does not linger as 
thickly here as it does outside. A pool of #1dried blood#0 
encrusts the bottom of the room with several #1bloody 
footprints#0 leading away into the western corridor.

A Dank, Domed Room~
   This domed chamber provides a largely open area to the dusty 
equipment underneath of it. A few computer screens, and the 
other structures, line the western part of the chamber and curve 
to the walls. Detritus also lines the floor, in various forms: 
excrement, pieces of polycrete, trash from food and other 
sources. It is largely quiet, the polycrete walls subduing most 
sounds from the outside. 
   There is an encrusted rust red spot pooled and dribbled on the 
floor. The wall has the following message, in the same 
substance: #1...we all fall down.#0

A Wide, Circular Landing Around a Shaft~
   The floor follows the circular edges of this domed room. 
Curved walls rise with support beams to the apex of the dome 
overhead, about eighteen feet above. Underneath, the polycrete 
walls are plain and unadorned. At the very center of the floor 
is a cylindrical shaft, maybe six feet in diameter, with a sturdy 
metal ladder bearing textured rungs leading below. Off to the 
north and west are cylindrical corridors, like pipes themselves. 
   This room is littered with refuse and what would appear to be 
slimy human bones. Organic growths cling to the wall and other 
pieces of garbage strewn around.

A Large, Horizontally Cylindrical Room~
   Large enough for an average-sized adult man to walk straight, 
this room looks rather similar to a large pipe. It leads off 
into a blast door at the end of the makeshift hallway. The 
bottom is flat like an ordinary floor, with a rubberized textured 
strip down the center to allow for better footing. Cracks mar 
the walls, in some cases chunks having fallen away. A faint 
scent of excrement lingers in the air. 
   A series of #1bloody footprints#0 track along the floor, along 
with a series of strange, wispier marks.

   Pipes run the sides and everywhere around this room, overhead 
or low enough to clothesline an adult. A faint rushing sound can 
be heard, along with the occasional drip-drip from pipes that 
have not been properly maintained. Underfoot, the floor is damp, 
though much of the moisture seeps slowly towards a grated drain 
in the middle of the floor. The station itself is defunct and 
dark, parts of it clearly rusted.

A Damp, Earth-Scented Domed Alcove~
   Centered around a defunct water purifier are a number of 
troughs, each curved to fit the circular room. Gaps are in 
between some of them, allowing passage in between which almost 
gives the impression of a maze the way they interconnect. The 
air is thick and damp with the scent of earth and plant rot. 
Most of the dirt in the troughs had gone dry, and there's a faint 
clicking and clank periodically.

   All types of electronic machinery fills this room, in addition

faint crackle of static can be felt in the air, though most of 
the screens and apparati appear to be defunct and silent. Dust 
hangs over most of it, clinging to the screens and clogging 
filters. From somewhere in the walls - or maybe some of the 
machinery - can be heard a low, irritating hum that is only 
perceptible if listened for.

Expansive, Domed Room at the Bottom of a Shaft~
   The vaulted shape of this polycrete room rises at least 
fifteen feet to the air. At the center of the dome itself is a 
cylindrical shaft, leading up into the area above. From it 
descends a sturdy metal ladder with textured rungs, allowing an 
open air climb into the portion above. The rest of the room 
descends in a steep curve towards the edges, the floor circular. 
A layer of dust has settled over ruined pieces of furniture, and 
clogs the senses along with the faint smell of excrement. 
   On part of the curved wall has been painted in a rust red 
substance: #1A crude mural or drawing of a circular object of 
some sort, with small bloody handprints surrounding it. There 
are also vaguely insectoid shapes painted off to the sides, all

A Large, Communal Bathroom~
   Long and rectangular shaped, this room is pretty plain, made of polycrete 
all around. The walls seem to be in fair repair, only a few cracks present 
coupled with what appear to be blade-scrapes on the northern wall. Like the 
walls, the floor is bland and grey, though has raised areas and grooves to 
allow a better grip. Along one portion of the walls run a series of shower 
heads with knobs, no curtains to be seen. Adjacent and off in one corner are 
several bathroom stalls with toilets and open fronts. The room, all in all, 
appears rather clean. Though patches of deep stain still mark the floor in 
spots, it's certainly better than a bar bathroom.

forelorn, derelict look to it with pieces mildewed paper 
scattered around on the floor, and very dim lighting. Over on 
one wall hangs a cracked, flat digital screen that is no longer 
in working order. A rather large gouge runs down the wall.

Long chamber of Polycrete Cubicles~
   On either side of this long chamber, leading from the metal 
blast door to the back wall are a number of sectioned off, 
polycrete cubicles. Each is probably twenty by fifteen by 
fifteen: a small space, but still some space. Otherwise, the 
rest of the room is plain polycrete. Intermittenly is smeared 
various substances. Some are green, some are brown, and some the 
telltale rust red of dried blood. The air inside contains 
dankness with undertones of organic rot and sewage.

Polycrete Corridor Lined with Lockers~
   On either side of a walkway are luckers and benches both, 
leading straight back towards a room further down on either end. 
Most of the lockers have been eaten away with rust, and the room 
smells not only like a locker room but an ancient one. Growths 
of some kind can be seeping out of the edges of the lockers, 
dribbling down towards the floor in their quest for nutrients. 
   In one spot on the floor, underneath a bench is a pool of 
#1dried blood#0. There does not appear to be anything leading to 
or away from it, but it would appear to have dripped down from 
the bench above.

A Rubble-Strewn Path~
   Scorched polycrete has been blasted into bits and pieces, at time little 
more than granules of fine dust, about the nearby surrounds. A small, 
snakelike path winds its way through the rubble from the eastern road to the 
southern, seemingly cleared by some unknown person or persons with endeavors of 
their own. On the edge of the path, a bit of structural framework has 
maintained its integrity, allowing a single arched doorway with a cross marked 
over it to stand amidst the utter destruction which has befallen the entirety 
of the area.

  Twisted and torn metal hunks of metal pierce up through the 
debris-filled ground throughout the nearby surrounds, indicative 
of the masses of shanties and weakly-constructed structures which 
once claimed the area as their own. The occassional bit of scrap 
plastic drifts by, carried by some unseen breeze as it meanders 
through the wreckage on an adventure all its own. A small path 
has been cleared through the rubble towards a squat building to 
the west, painted an intense dingy orange with murals of 
flashball players in action adorning its outer walls. A set of 
polyplastic double-doors leads into the facility, a crooked 
sign mounted above welcoming those entering within.

A handscanner along the western gate can be used via #6EXIT BASE#0.

slowly degrading from a lack of maintenance and obvious efforts 
to mar its surface as made evident by missing chunks of polycrete 
laid deep within. The corridor continues to the north, while 
simultaneously allowing passage back into the southern lobby.

   A half-door, worn and constructed of of fading orange 
polyplastic, sits to the west, allowing entrance onto the 
flashball court beyond. The blue polymesh carpet below has been 
worn thin, no doubt by the constant shuffle of flashballers 
entering and exiting the court. A thick odor lingers in the air

seem to emanate from the northern doorway which has #6a small

   Gritty polycrete composes the ground below, years-old 
bloodstains and other markings of dubious origins marring its 
surface. Similarly unmoving polycrete makes up the surrounding 
walls, set at half-length on the southern edge with only a 
polyplastic half-door set into the eastern face allowing entrance 
of exit. A flashball net has been installed along the southern 
wall, notches etched into its surface along with the markings of 
various teams. To the south, a large section of clear 
polyplastic allows for those seated beyond to view the goings on 
of the court. Heavy-metal fans hang above, only their 
no-nonsense bolts and inconvenient location likely keeping them 
away from the prying hands of scavengers past, while the court 
continues northwards.

the rickety staircase missing a number of steps. The floor, however, seems to 
be the most pristine part of the entire place, looking to have been refinished 
since the ravaging of the rest of the structure. The place is most often 
utterly quiet, the atmosphere subdued, and seems to cursory inspection to be 
completely abandoned.

A Shop Strewn With Ruined Wares~
   What was once a bustling shop is strewn with debris, its ceiling sagging 
down towards the floor. Barely kept up by a few wavering support rods, scraps 
of armor litter the store-front, stiff fabrics rendered useless by the 
destruction, snagged by rubble. A few former display mannequins litter the 
place as well, their faceless shapes still adorned by useless scraps of the 
armor they once were used to sell. Anything of use has long-since been looted.

A Large, Polycrete-Floored Shop~
   This large space serves as a shop, with scuffed polycrete 
floors and walls and ceilings composed of the same ridge-textured 
flimsy metal. About five feet directly in front of the entrance 
a small counter stands isolated, with the room's singular light 
dangling from a cord above. On either side of this counter is a 
dingy metal shelf, each decorated with an assortment of 
sour-smelling glass vials; many of them have been set with yellow 
stickers, on which deftly hand-drawn symbols in black ink depict 
a skull, a fire, fumes or any combination of the three. Hanging 
from the light fixture is a sign that reads "Drugs, Flavorings 
and Other Chemical Compounds". With no windows and minimal 
cracks in the walls, several square feet of the room empty, 
making the footsteps echo and conversations buzz ominously. 
Several feet back through the darkness rests a heavy metal door, 
set in a wall that has been crudely but effectively reinforced by 
welding.

   All hardwood flooring and cold metal, this room is empty and

Wilmington Wears and Tears Emporium~
   This cramped room is made to look larger as most of the wares 
are on the wall and a handful of thin tables that run the length 
of the store. A single support beam sits bare in the room's 
center, holding up the roof above. The floors are scuffed and 
old, yet they are well kept and clean. The most expensive and 
fragile of items are on display behind the sales counter in the 
back. Though old and reused, the room is kept bright with more 
rows of light than seems to be needed to light the space.

A Ruined Shopfront~
   Against all odds, the walls of this building have managed to 
remain standing, though they are, at most, on their last legs. 
The roof sags in, on the verge of collapse, and the windows are 
missing from their panes and door from its frame. In contrast, 
there is an unnerving precision of how all the shelves are bolted 
into the walls, though the wares have spilled all over the 
ground. A wired wall sits behind the counter, barring access to 
the medical supplies beyond. The walls are a bland white and the 
floor is a nondescript gray. It would be completely devoid of 
any ornamentation if not for a large red cross painted in the 
centre of the floor - if it can be called decor. Through the 
windows and door small amounts of trash and ash have piled, but 
aside from that, this building is quite clean.

An Intersection Surrounded by Ruined Streets~
   This street, which runs east and west, is littered with debris and flanked 
with shattered buildings which once sheltered the alleys that branch from it. 
A few small shanties litter the area, built on the ruins of old, but few people 
pass this way, and those who do generally hasten eastward. The skittering of 
small animals is often heard, with the very occasional gunshot echoing in the 
distance.

melted-down display dolls, a few bits of jewelry literally fused

Precarious Catwalk in an Abandoned Factory~
   Lined by a pair of rails, this catwalk runs high above the factory floor 
before, on the northern end of the room. Out of reach by perhaps the height of 
three men is an intricate series of overhead lights, beams, wiring, and pipes. 
The metal is in fair repair, though is showing signs of rust, and a look 
directly down through the grating shows a dizzying drop to the floor. Along 
one side, a sturdy but steep metal staircase leads to the floor below. On 
occasion, the catwalk shakes and trembles, either with moved weight or the 
response of some of the machinery above. At one part there is a great, gaping 
hole which exposes the entire place to the lunar sky.

walking around precarious. One of the walls has flopped outwards, taking beams 
and supports with it. Dirt and dust are everywhere, and one of the beams has 
fallen through a glass display case. Tattered posters of smoking camels, 
scantily clothed women, and other such scenes stick up out of the rubble, 
flapping in the wind.

   This room resembles a prison cell more than any other usage, and now a 
destroyed prison cell. Great hunks of polycrete have been torn away, and 
cracks plague the walls. Work counters lay on their sides, and this place is 
liberally trashed with various types of kitchen ware thrown around in every 
direction. It is a small room, with only a few people capable of fitting

Collapsed Ruin of La Revolucion~
   For the most part, this once proud establishment is exceedingly flat. Two 
of the walls have fallen in, crushing the former walkways, and with it some of 
the occupants at the time. Skeletons grope out from underneath rubble in 
desperation, and one can be found under the dusty, green felt-topped shape of a 
billard table. Sitting there as if it belongs, an "L" shaped bar is still on 
the northern part of the main room's ruin. A stuffed barker head with its face 
half caved-in lays amidst the mess.

   Twisted iron bars jut up out of the polycrete ruins of walls that make up 
this flattened shop, like bones of a time long past. Much of the rubble bears 
telltale signs of fire blackening, and the scent of charred flesh is barely 
discernable on the air. Most of this area is the same: a rolling mass of 
destruction, with an occasional usable piece sticking up out of it. A faint 
glint of gold can be seen, here and there.

pipes dribble befouled liquid into small puddles, which seeps down into cracks 
and the chamber below.

   This rather cramped basement has been reinforced with cracking concrete, its 
sagging ceiling held up by a few chrion support beams. A small hatch set into 
the ceiling is reachable by a make-shift set of alion stairs, looking to have 
not-long-ago replaced a ladder. Set into the thick wall opposite the stairs is 
an imposing door, looking to have been made solely of magnon, its manufacture 
seeming a fair bit less make-shift than the rest of the basement. Beside it, 
on the wall, is a small control panel.

   This cramped hallway widens ahead, the ceiling lined with dim lights that 
similarly brighten the further from the door you get. The sturdy door itself 
bears marks of plasma torches, deep, ineffectual gashes made in an apparent bid 
for escape, macabre graffiti lining the walls near it lending to this theory.

reinforced, and a few support beams scattered about for extra support. The 
cement walls, floor, and ceiling have been painted a drab, dirty white. The 
air is somewhat stale, clearly recirculated, and a foul stench wafts in from 
the east, though seems to not follow further along the hall.

A Comfortable Lounge~
   Once probably not more than a large sewer utility chamber, great lengths 
seem to have been taken to transform this rather spacious lounge to its current 
adequate state. The walls look to have been slabbed with a fresh swathe of 
white paint, though the thin layers in a few areas present evidence of poorly 
concealed bloodied smears or faded graffiti. Several large posters presenting 
old propaganda or recruitment flyers are pasted up throughout. The stagnant 
aroma of lingering tobacco and the faint smell of sweat has settled over the 
crowded hall. Thickly woven, blood-red carpet has been laid across the floor, 
remaining irregularly sparse from heavy traffic across it and even the darkened 
shade is unable to hide some of the more obscure stains. A sturdy door to the 
north provides access beyond, while the polyplastic door on the eastern side 
seems to have been a late addition, carved into the moonrock.

A Semi-Crowded Barracks~
   If this room were used for something other than sleeping quarters, perhaps 
it would be comfortable. As it stands, with the arrangements cramped into the 
space, there's the pervading stench of sweat from too many bodies living in one 
confined area. The granite-grey polyplastic floor is scuffed in some areas, 
but ultimately appears well-swept and clean. Standard-sized bunks line the 
barracks, with organized cubby spaces between each for the residents to leave 
personal effects. Small wall-hangings or painted canvas pictures have been 
tacked in various spots along the chrion-reinforced panels to identify some of 
the individual preferences. Taking up most of the northern wall is detailed 
mural, depicting the remains of a large, destroyed city, the husks of 
collapsing buildings shadowed with smoking embers. Superimposed upon it is all 
is a vivid, encircled-A, the bright red paint having dried with a dripping 
effect resembling blood. Beneath it is the bold lettering of a single, 
beseeching word: 'Remember'. A solid door to the east leads into the 
restrooms.

   Hewn coarsely from the moonrock, natural-hued panels of thick concrete make 
up the austere walls of this substantial mess hall. The floor has been evenly 
paved with triangular slabs of patterned slate grey and blood-red polyplastic 
tiles. Neat shelves are organized along the western wall and a long countertop 
serves as a partition to separate the kitchen and dining areas. Long, chrion 
banquet tables are set up side by side throughout the room, unadorned of any 
fancy embellishments and able to seat at least several dozen comfortably. A 
generous archway opens up into the hallway eastwards, the occasional draft 
bringing a cool breeze to filter through the otherwise stuffy area.

evident here, pipes clanking and generator echoing throughoug the orderly 
machinery hall. The door to the south is thickly sound-proof, and 
heat-resistant.

bright, specialized lights hanging from the low-lying ceiling to provide light 
for the growth of the plants in the rows of alion troughs. There are about a 
dozen rows in all, spaced with little room to walk between. Pipes run beneath 
the troughs, sprinklers rising here and there to provide water. The floors and 
walls are kept meticulously clean and orderly and spare, save for the line of 
shelves running across one wall.

Dingy Restrooms~
   Divided into sides for men and women, with appropriate metal sheets to 
divide the pair, these cramped quarters are composed of two sets of showers and 
two sets of latrines. Built for function over form, it's crudely hewn into the 
moonrock, a decided expansion from the sewer-origins of this facility.

A Damp Utility Plant, Surrounded By Pipes~
   Deeper into the tangle of machinery, and humming generators, this damp 
corner of the utility plant is a maze of pipes and conveyor belts. Everything 
is kept particularly neat, though the air is a bit thick with moisture, the 
sound of clanking and flowing water almost deafening the closer you get to the 
heart of the system.

is maintained to provide traction for any complicated dancing routines. There 
are stairs leading back down towards the lounge proper. The platform is raised 
high enough for anyone standing on it to be completely visible to the rest of 
the patrons of the lounge. There is a small latch that allows access to a 
dancing pole that can be raised. The pole is currently #6raised#0 and can be

A Viewing Room Above a Factory Floor~
   Much of the basic framework of this room has been left untouched, the walls 
a bland, grey polycrete in color, as is the floor. The beams overhead are 
still exposed, as is the system of wiring and the pipes that carry an 
occasional glugging sound. All along the eastern wall has been set a massive, 
clear polyprop window which allows one to look down at the factory floor below. 
Set underneath is a communications and lighting console. To the south is 
another door, more reinforced than the one leading back to a catwalk.

series of electronic controls and breaker boxes. It is almost impeccably 
clean, except for the moondust which seems to find its way everywhere. That, 
and a rather large #1dried bloodstain#0 that seems to take up most of the

to be a large, communal shower room. Several showerheads line each wall, with 
dual knobs placed beneath. Mildew-stained off-white curtains serve as an 
abysmal partition between each, the attempt at privacy failing overall. A 
small, circular drain is set beneath each one, the floor gradually sloped to

A Cozy Security and Control Center~
   Ample enough, though not as large as some of the other rooms in the factory, 
this chamber bears rubberized panels on its walls and half its floor which have 
been tinted a rich shade of golden topaz. The plasticized surface seems 
perfect for supporting and housing any variety of electronics equipment while 
affording insulation and grounding to the equipment. The other half of the 
floor bears a plush, hand-hooked carpet extending in all directions, of a deep 
garnet red hue, which forms a soft pool of flooring in the forward section of 
the room near the exit. A #2biometric handscanner#0 has been installed beside

Churning, Pipe-Filled Room~
   This massive room takes up pretty much the entire space beneath the factory 
above, full of a virtual maze of pipes running overhead and in some areas, like 
a forest nearby to the walls. From the center array the span the entire area 
wooshing, churning, and gurgling. Much of the rest of the room has been left 
as plain, grey polycrete. One rather thick pipe descends from above at odd 
angles, and there is a drain in the middle of the floor. Dust clings to 
everything.

   Paneled with polyprop slats that have been imprinted to resemble wood, this

rendered bald, apparently by peeling, most of if still stretches from wall to 
paneled wall intact. Overhead, track lighting runs the length of the room

A Private Office~
   Paneled in slats of polyprop that have been molded to resemble dark wood, 
this rectangular room has been set up into a modest office. The rough carpet 
underfoot is sparse in some areas, the midnight-black weave concealing a few 
dark and obscure stains. Dominating the western wall is a large, gothic-style 
window, etched with ancient tribal markings around the chrion perimeter. 
Golden-toned curtains are draped across the southern wall, embroidered a 
display of two enormous snakes with blood-red slits for eyes, entangled within 
and around a humanoid skull.

Expansive Sky-Lit Room Atop a Factory~
   Sprawling the entire third floor of the factory is a single room, polycrete 
reinforced with metal beams. Overhead is a skylight of shattered, clear 
plastic, likewise on a skeleton of partially smashed steel, allowing tinted 
view of the sun or stars as the time presents. The rest of it is fairly 
spartan, except for a number of troughs which line the entire length, holding 
dried soil. At the northern part of the room is a recirculation pump, covered 
in a layer of dust and completely powered down. Part of the floor has been 
shorn away completely, leaving a #3gaping hole#0 underneath the one in the 
skylight. A hatch flush against the floor leads to a precarious, metal 
staircase and a catwalk.

floor, causing it to crumble away and the structure to sink in that direction. 
Whatever made it seems to have driven straight down through, to hit the factory 
floor beneath. Above, the skylight is also cracked, shattered, and in some 
regions scorched and melted.

A Humming, Static-Filled Room~
   Static hangs heavily in the air, making any bodily hair stand on-end for 
whoever enters this room. It plays counterpoint to a humming that fills the 
airs, and can give a dizzying effect if left for too long. The entire expanse 
is polycrete, seeming to extend past the boundaries of the factory above. 
Cables are everywhere, and a few pipes as well. Along one wall has been 
installed a control panel and displays.

Backstage Private Quarters~
   Desks are arranged here row by row, and back to back from each other, not 
unlike a factory assembly line. The desks are simply-made and include a 
cabinet for storing little things. On the top of each desk, towards the back 
edge, is a framed mirror rising just past an average woman's hips, allowing 
performers to fix every detail of their clothing before their routine. Light 
bulbs are set around the mirrors' frames to simulate the lighting from the 
lounge proper. To the right of each desk is a tall, narrow locker with a pole 
by the top and a couple of hangers for holding clothing. The southern wall 
contains a board filled with various notes, including show assignments, routine 
schedules, current roster, as well as the names of a few people of "special" 
distinction. Propped up beside the board, just beside the exit, is a full-body 
mirror for exiting performers to make last minute touch ups.

Inside the Bar~
   The floor is tiled with some black rubber matting, evidently needed with all 
the occasional spills that occur over the course of the day. There are a few 
cabinets and drawers under the bar table and on the wall behind. The bar's low 
ceiling also has some slots to hang some bottles and other things of interest 
to the discerning patron. This area is where the bartender keeps his wares.

A Manufacturing Chamber~
   Separated from the lounge to the west by a particularly sturdy door, this 
spacious chamber was carved from the moonrock itself, all manner of industrial 
machinery set about neatly. A rather large vent is set above the bits that run 
the hottest, funneling the oppressive heat outward, the machinery that 
recirculates air running rather loudly.

Second Terrace of a Commercial Center~
   This polyprop-floored terrace is held upon aged polycrete pillars which 
enclose magnon-alloy rods. Metal rails line the edges as it curves around a 
square shape allowing a look below, hugging close to walls which play host to a 
variety of shops lined around. Most would seem to be filled with essential 
goods, rather than anything purely for enjoyment or show. Over a shop 
positioned along the northern part of the walkway is #2a sign depicting a robot 
and circuitboard#0 and adjacent to the east is a store with #2a sign with a 
brightly decorated pallet#0. Steeply jutting off the side and leading 
downwards is a plastic, railed staircase which allows passage back to the main 
level.

A Machinery Store Smelling of Metal~
   Aromas of grease, heated metal, and electrical short circuits pervade this 
area. One part seems to be something of a work shop, arrayed with a bench and 
various machinery left about, along with a wall of tools just above. The rest 
has bins and shelves, the former sometimes under the latter and full of pieces. 
A wide selection of molds is proudly displayed in the clear polyprop 
counter-case along the northern wall.

   This dingy shop is lined by shelves full of various wares and goods, of all 
manner of uses relating to making impliments of warefare. Tools, bits and 
pieces, and other things might all be found. Provided one desires to do a bit 
of digging to get there. A few wary-eyed Wilmington Guards keep watch. The 
light overhead is rather poor, though it is even worse on the landing outside. 
Along the northern wall runs a polyprop counter painted to look like marble, a 
sturdy door standing behind it.

lighting that is reasonably good to allow easy viewing of the wares.

Shaded Alleys At the Edges of the Marketplace~
   The overhang of the built-up Marketplace shades this area from the sun and 
the reflected light of the Earth. The hard dirt ground is sticky with blood 
and other unsanitary stains, and a small pile of garbage is built up against 
the wall of the marketplace, likely dumped there from the tenement buildings 
that rise up overhead. From this location, a dozen winding alleys and paths 
split off, letting one slink away and rejoin the rest of Grungetown when they 
so desire.

which is left bare and untouched save for some texturing to allow a better grip

and, of course, dust. A plain counter runs before a door to the north.

A Large, Standing Shower Stall~
   Two sides of this shower stall are composed of polycrete sprayed over with a 
thick enough coat of vivid indigo paint to keep them from being abrasive. The 
other two sides are made of a thick, natural-hued vinyl shower curtain, which 
hangs by plastic rings from a curve of pipe that has been bolted high to the 
wall. The shower stall is quite large, being a good four foot by four foot. 
Its base has been formed out of plastic, with a three inch high and two inch 
wide rim to keep water from spilling over. The floor of the base slopes down 
toward its center, where a small metal grate allows the water to drain. All of 
the plastic has been coated with a thick layer of some type of resin, textured 
to give it some grip, as have all the seams between plastic, wall and floor. 
In the north wall, a jimmy-rigged apparatus with two valves, one painted red, 
one painted blue, protrudes from the wall, the wall behind it sealed with a 
thick patch of resin. A thin, kinked pipe has been bolted to the wall, leading 
up from the valves until it curves about seven feet up where it connects to a 
foot wide, industrial-type shower head.

A Comfortable Bedroom~
   This small room is rather richly appointed for what one might expect in 
Grungetown. A thick, burgundy carpet covers a polycrete floor, while the walls 
have been painted with rich and vibrant murals. The themes of the various 
scenes appear to be highly diversified, though almost all seem to be centered 
on happier times in Grungetown, a couple watching the sun set here, and a view 
of an intact Grungetown there. Many of the scenes appear to have a central 
Vulture theme, of people and buildings long since gone. Four recessed lights 
in the ceiling cast a mellow, almost natural lighting over the room. Taking up 
almost half of the room is a large, plush and very comfortable seeming bed. 
Built into one corner is a small shower stall, which allows only a light rain 
of water when in use, but certainly enough for one to clean up. A heavily 
secured metal door sits in the southern wall, while a passage in the northern 
wall allows access to a large storage room.

   Although small, this shop is carefully organized and maintained, longer than

walls are bright, hung with racks of goods all laid out for display. The small 
counter is made of metal and bolted to the ground, but covered with a bright 
blue, embroidered cloth, a few smaller items set atop it for browsing. Before 
the front door is a thick yellow rug embroidered with a green serpent. A 
locked door in the back leads to another room.

The Western Wing of a Large Greenhouse~
   This room is long and narrow, running from east to west, only about a dozen 
feet wide, but almost twice as long. The walls and ceiling of the room are 
made up of well-constructed alion scaffold. The rods of iron alloy cross each 
other at evenly spaced distances, each support neatly welded to the other at 
every junction. Within the large gaps of the scaffolding, large squares of 
thin, translucent green polyprop have been fused to the frame, keeping the room 
safe from the weather outside, while allowing large amounts of sunlight in. 
Bundles of equipment, wires and piping run throughout the greenhouse, all 
helping to support the crops growing within. Small, open entries have been set 
into the eastern and western walls, opening into other sections of the 
greenhouse.

   Though lacking on space, great care has been put upon transforming this 
otherwise cramped shack into a more cozy or charming atmosphere. Evenly 
paneled walls have been painted a fresh shade of pale jade green with textured 
black molding. The modest entryway has been tiled with square cuts of stark 
white polyplastic, while a trim, shaggy black carpet covers the majority of the 
floor. Coarse black curtains partition off a small section of the eastern 
wall, laid out to be a tiny kitchenette. There is a lingering scent of mint 
herbals throughout. A sturdy door with chrion hinges allows for entry to and 
from the shack along the southern wall.

A Small, Cozy Bedroom~
   Deep red carpeting, well-padded and soft to the touch, covers the floor of 
this small, cozy bedroom. The walls have been painted a singular shade of deep 
black, the paint thick, with a slightly rough texture. A slender opening cuts 
through the southern edge of the eastern all, allowing passage into the next 
room, and is covered with a thick curtain of burgundy velvet polymesh. The 
room is lit by a single recessed row of high end lighting, which is controlled 
by a small dimmer switch set beside the doorway. There also appear to be 
several dozen tiny little LED lights of soft weight sunk into the walls and 
ceiling, which turn on when the main light is switched off. The slowly 
twinkling LEDs, combined with the black walls, give the feel of being out under 
the open stars at night. The room itself is fairly small, giving only room for 
a decently sized bed and a locker or two. Much of the remaining free space is 
taken up by a small, neatly constructed shower stall in the northwestern 
corner, which is covered in by a black vinyl shower curtain and its broad 
shower head lit by a soft, single light above. All in all, this bedroom has a 
feel of newness, and elegance, not often seen in Grungetown.

A Well-lit Hydroponics Room~
   This room has an array of bright, specialized lights that hang from the 
low-lying ceiling, providing light for the growth of the rows of plants in 
their plastic troughs. There are about a dozen rows in all, spaced with a 
little room to walk in between. Pipes run beneath the troughs, sprinklers 
rising here and there to provide water. The floors and walls are kept 
meticulously clean and orderly, save for the line of shelves running across one 
wall. This room is adjacent to another section of hydroponics, leading 
eastwards, westwards and southwards.

The South Hydroponics Wing~
   The concrete walls of this part of the greenhouse have been painted with 
lushful colors, an attempt to create an interior jungle scene complete with 
exotic birds. Specialized low-hanging lights brighten the area, making the 
colors of the paintings more vivid and vibrant. In the middle of the room, a 
small fountain is connected to the trough water lines, recirculating the water 
and adding some ambient sounds over the humming of the pumps. Many rows of 
troughs are positioned in a rather artistic way, circling around the chrion 
fountain. They still maintain their usefulness, however, keeping a practical 
side. A chrion bench has been set next to the fountain, giving this room a 
more relaxing atmosphere. A blown glass door leads northwards through more 
hydroponics.

A Refurbished Sitting Room~
   Still having the chemical smell of paint, this room seems to have been 
reworked recently and appears to have a vaguely antique quality. The walls are 
textured with resurfaced, roughly mended cracks, painted over with a thick coat 
of warm grey paint. Supporting the abused walls and ceilings are exposed, dark 
grey plastic supports. A thick chrion door leads to the south out into the 
street, and to the north in a rounded archway a dark green curtain made of 
translucent cloth hangs, leading to the next small room. The floor is composed 
of a raw, solid polycrete, left unpainted.

The Buzzard's Beaker~
   While solid polycrete littered with scuffs and probably glitter composes the 
floor below, tall chrion beams between black-painted walls, swirled with pink, 
hold the buildings framework together beneath a sheet-plastic roof. For the 
most part, this area is dark, perpetually in low-light. Smoke often wafts 
through the air and there seems to be a never-leaving heady scent of booze and 
sweat. To the right is a small bar, and toward the back of the room is an 
equally small stage complete with metal pole with a little DJ booth beside it. 
A few tables and chairs are scattered over the floor as well, making the room a 
bit on the crowded side. The walls are covered with speakers, scattered here 
and there, and long rows of paintings of nude women, in various poses and 
states of undress. What would appear to be lights, of all colors, hang from 
the metal beams overhead and often twinkle or spark, only adding to the general 
bawdy ambiance. A thin, chrion stairway on the southern wall leads up to a 
small platform and a curtained doorway. In the eastern wall sits a thick, 
secure door, a biometric handscan mounted beside it. A wide, solid door in the 
northern wall leads out to the street. During almost any shift of the phase, 
girls can be found performing on stage.

A Dimly-Lit Dressing Room~
   Little effort was put into decorating this room and it is really no bigger 
than the expanse of a shack. The floor is a a shaggy, black carpet atop bland 
polycrete and the windowless walls haven't truly been painted save the rampant 
graffiti. This room smells of sweat, sex, and sweet-synthetic fragrances. 
Skimpy clothing often litters the floor- as well as glitter, and make-up 
smears. A long, narrow counter stretches across the back wall, a few lighted 
mirrors behind it. A mere curtain rests between this room and the small 
platform and stairs down into the common room next door.

warmth or comfort. Its walls are lined with shelves, which in turn are filled 
with bottles and cups and other goods used to keep the bar stocked. A secure 
door sits heavily in the western wall, a biometric hand scanner mounted beside 
it.

West Wing of the Hydroponics~
   This room has an array of bright, specialized lights that hang from the 
low-lying ceiling, providing light for the growth of the rows of plants in 
their plastic troughs. There are about a dozen rows in all, spaced with a 
little room to walk inbetween. Pipes run beneath the suspended troughs, 
sprinklers rising here and there to provide water. The floors and walls are 
kept meticulously clean and orderly, save for the line of shelves running 
across one wall. This room is adjacent to another section of hydroponics, 
leading eastwards.

shade of pink. Items of an adult nature are set out on display in every 
direction, with various massage oils and lubes for sale on one shelf while 
pornographic magazines and toys are organized nearby. Female mannequins 
wearing lingerie or fantasy-fetish clothing have been posed along the walls. A 
curtained passageway in the northern wall leads to the club proper. The other 
walls each have their own door, leading into VIP and private rentable rooms.

The Glam Room~
   On the smaller side, this room is about bedroom sized. It's walls have been 
painted with vibrant murals, all of which appear to be themed around a central 
figure, a curvy, and typically nude young woman. The painted scenes appear to 
be snapshots from various dances, the luscious, supple form of the young woman 
with curly hair the color of rubies, with pearl white and rose quartz streaks 
captured in an assortment poses. The room is well lit by an assortment of 
vari-colored diode panels, many of which are focused on a small, slowly turning 
disco ball mounted to the ceiling. A small speaker has been mounted on each 
wall, filling the room with the same music playing out in the club, though at a 
more reasonable volume. Scatterings of glitter can be found all over the room, 
and it's likely that anyone who spends time here will walk out with a bit of it 
on them. The room itself appears neat, and is likely cleaned after each 
rental. A door has been set into the western wall which is securely locked.

   On the smaller side, this room is about bedroom sized. It's walls have been 
painted a soot-black color, and the room itself is only dimly lit. The theme 
of this room is fairly easy to notice, with rings mounted into the walls at 
various heights, padded cuffs and leather bonds attached to many of them. 
Lining the far wall is a single shelf which holds an assortment of flogs, 
paddles, bondage gear and a variety of sex toys wide enough to cover just about 
any scenario. Even the bed, its head pushed to the southern wall, has has an 
adjustable leather cuff attached to each corner. A door has been set into the

A Circular Ritual Chamber~
   Crafted of plastic and metal and scattered with shadows despite new-enough 
wiring, this room retains a haunted quality, as much is cloaked in darkness. A 
circular section in the center of the space escapes the gloom and settled to 
one end of it is a massive altar. Kept clean and swept, the floor is simple 
polyconcrete. Care has been taken to carve a scene onto the surface: an 
enormous serpent coiled and twisting, the head of it resting in the dead center 
of the room, guarding a large inset #3circular well#0 stained rusty 
reddish-brown. The walls have been draped in thick fabric, dull black velvet 
embroidered with gold and green thread in intricate, interlocking designs. 
Makeshift candles have been placed everywhere in the periphery, lit or unlit at 
various times of the phase.

The Clean Lobby of a Shop Complex~
   Obvious care has gone into making this lobby more than just a functional 
space. Its dark grey polycrete floors have been sealed with a luster, the 
surface nearly gleaming. The walls of the lobby have been painted with rich 
and vibrant murals which appear to depict various scenes of Grungetown from 
before the battle that destroyed half of the town. One scene depicts children 
at play in the middle of a busy road, while another shows a scene from a 
crowded, neon lit strip club, and another a lively, bustling marketplace, 
lacking the filth and crude shanties one would expect to see there today. Four 
recessed lights in the ceiling cast a mellow, almost natural lighting over the 
room. Potted plants sit on small stands, here and there along the walls, 
adding a pleasant smell to the room. There are always people around, many 
baring the marks of the various Families, and so with no markings at all. They 
slip in and out of the connecting shops, or sometimes simply linger in the 
lobby to conduct business of their own. A heavy metal gate takes up almost 
half of the southern wall, while passageways in the other walls lead off to 
individual shops.

The Trader's Emporium~
   Neat and tidy, this small store front has a very fresh feel to it. A thick, 
burgundy carpet covers a polycrete floor, while the walls have been painted 
with rich and vibrant murals. The overall theme of the murals appears to be 
anthropomorphic Vultures, involved in various scenes of commerce. One section 
of wall shows a market with a pair of Vultures hawking assorted goods, and 
another depicts a group of Vultures caravanning across the barren moonscape, 
and the scenes go on and on. Cutting the room in half is a highly polished 
chrion counter, its top covered with thick black plastic, with a small gate off 
to the eastern side to allow access to the back of the store front. Four 
recessed lights in the ceiling cast a mellow, almost natural lighting over the 
room. The northern wall is lined with well-crafted racks, which display a wide 
variety of goods, from bits of technology to bottles of chemicals, to bits of 
armor and paintings and more. A heavily secured metal door sits in the wall 
between two racks, a small hand scanner mounted beside it to allow access to a 
back room.

Cutting the room in half is a highly polished chrion counter, its top covered

Inside A Spacious Tent~
   The walls and ceiling of this spacious tent are all crafted of coarse black 
polymesh, held aloft by numerous metal poles. Sturdy enough in construction, 
the space is still a tent and so the protection it offers serves mostly as both 
shade and privacy. Flaps have been cut into three of the four 'walls' and can 
be pulled away to allow airflow and light to stream in from the outside. On 
the fourth surface is a slit serving as an entrance and exit by pushing aside 
the flap. Tall enough that only the tallest would have to make any adjustment 
in stance, several people and items could fit within the enclosure.

Inside a Low, Windowless Shack~
   Constructed mainly from corrugated sheet metal, this shack is low and squat. 
It lacks windows, giving it a slightly claustrophobic air, and the interior is 
very cramped. Boxes of junk, piles of bags and other largely worthless things 
take up most of the space, though most has been stored in as practical and 
unobtrsive ways as possible. One end of the room has been half walled off by 
stacks of crates reaching almost to the building's uneven ceiling. Allowing 
some measure of privacy, this section contains one bunk bed and a couple of 
dirty mattresses strewn across the floor. A quarter of the shack has been 
separated by an actual wall with a scratched door, and a strange chemical smell 
wafts from within.

   Beyond the door of the shack's main room is a space just wide enough for a

eye-watering and obviously comes from the contraption sitting on the table. 
Measuring cylinders, test tubes and empty capsules litter the table as well as 
the floor beneath it, and the room is lit by a single naked light-bulb hanging 
from a cord that snakes its way in from the main room.
