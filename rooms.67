A Cavernous Lobby~
   By Grungetown standards this room would be considered cavernous. Wide open 
and constructed of a blend of steel-grey concrete and moonrock inlaid with 
veins of high grade white polyprop that present a marbled effect, this spacious 
chamber is home to a single desk set at the far end that serves as the 
reception area. The wall behind the faux-woodgrain, polyprop reception station 
is dominated by #2an immense#0 #1red 'W'#0 #2set within a circle#0. The floor 
is tition-alloy and textured in a gridwork pattern bare of any manner of 
covering. Inlaid in the floor's surface, before the desk at the far end, is a 
mirror image of the wall design. In the southwestern corner of the room a 
security checkpoint sits before a reinforced doorway leading to polycrete 
stairs beyond, #2a small sign#0 bolted next to the doorway reading, 
#9"AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY"#0. Similarly, in the southeast corner of the 
room, polycrete stairs descend below. The rest of the room is bare, save for a 
solitary potted plant that rests atop the reception desk. 

The northern metal doors have been reinforced with a magnon bars. A 
#2biometric handscanner#0 is bolted against the wall.

An Expansive Data Library~
   Though sparsely decorated, this room has clearly been set up 
as a memorial to Dom Wilmington. Murals covering every wall 
depict the patriarch of the Wilmington family, in various stages 
of his life, engaged in a myriad of philanthropic and heroic 
activities. One depicts Dom Wilmington singlehandedly defending 
a group of terrified orphans from a rampaging lagato, while 
another depicts the Wilmington patron dispensing food and 
medicine to a gathering of lower-class women and children and a 
third shows an older Dom reading to a group of scientists from a 
blackboard full of complicated equations. The actual contents of 
the room are far more practical; rows of computer workstations 
line one wall while the others are home to racks of labelled data 
sticks and holodiscs. There is even a shelf containing a number 
of old-world books. The library is carefully climate controlled 
to prevent the compromise of its contents.

A Spacious Office~
   Under a panelled ceiling, this spacious office has been built 
from stained black polyprop beams, nailed and affixed to the rock 
outcropping, screwed in with large rusting iron bolts. Shelves 
and benches are set here, where equipment and tools have been 
left for those who work here. While the maple-panelled partition 
stretches north-south about the western door and rises to half 
the height of the room, at the opposite side of this space the 
ceiling plunges and a stone block wall sports a stylish black W. 
Cold and damp, the stone floor here shows bumps and ridges, where 
stalagmites have been sorn and rubbed flat, dripstones split by 
picks not long ago and set flat. 

Through the square window, the well-illuminated exterior of the 
entrance to the complex can be seen.

Wilmington Guard Operations Center~
   Walking through the doorway from the northern chamber, it is 
quickly noticed that this large, spacious room is designed with a 
Gothic-style architecture in mind. Extravagant, carved pillars 
made of white stone line the length of the room from north to 
south, jutting out from the dark, marbled-painted polyprop floor 
to brace against the arched ceiling. The windowless-provided 
darkness of the room is illuminated with the golden light from 
the antique-looking lamps hung on hooks upon stone pillar. The 
ceiling itself is a mass of tracery, very complex and extravagant 
in design, in which circles, squares, octagons and other figures 
appear, with bosses and great pendants at the intersections. 
Each pillar in the room is carved in a scrolling, precise design, 
each with carved ivy and leaves, mixing and mingling with the 
room-darkened real ivy growing up all along the walls to present 
an even more archaic setting. 

#2A small intercom pad#0 has been set into the western wall, 
which you realize allows you to #6PRESS INTERCOM#0 followed by 
any message you would wish to relay throughout the entire 
Wilmington center. 

A magnon-reinforced door is set in the western wall, a biometric

   This cell is relatively small and cramped, room enough for

and colorless polyprop walls on each wallside except to the west, 
where a large iron-banded reinforced door has been placed. A 
secured makeshift shutter has been implanted into the door about 
five feet off the ground but otherwise this room remains clean

   This vault is made primarily of reinforced, thick 
titon-and-magnon-weaved polycrete, titon plates incorporated into 
the walls, floors and ceiling to slow down any would-be 
safe-crackers who may attempt to tunnel into the vault. 
Vibration and sound detectors pepper the walls and accumulate 
sounds and set off an alarm if a lot of noise is made over a 
period of hours. The vault is locked with a secured with a heavy 
circular door about three feet thick, unlocked and opened with a 
retractable set of magnon bars along its side. As one steps into 
the room, dull flourescent lights flicker on to reveal firearm 
and weapons racked neatly along each wall whilst safe deposit 
boxes lay beneath, one every twelve inches.

walls constructed of a blend of steel-grey concrete and moonrock 
inlaid with veins of high grade white polyprop that present a 
marbled effect. A single row of lights cast a warm amber glow 
off of the area, shadows cast awkwardly by the reflection. To

plain doorway, while the hallway itself allows passage to the 
north and south.

   Square and drab, this cramped office comes with little in the

and adorned only with a smattering of hastily scribbled notes 
here and there. On the floor below a large, worn rug constructed 
of layered red polymesh fabric helps to offset the gloom, but 
only slightly. Two small desks backed up near the north and 
south walls, each with a small computer bolted onto their

   This vast and spartan chamber contains little in the way of 
creature comforts. The center of the semi-circular room is 
sunken in the fashion of an an amphitheater, complete with raised 
rows of bench seating constructed of bleached concrete. #2A 
massive gold W set within a circle#0 dominates the back wall of 
the room, a plainly visible reminder to those present of the 
wealth and influence of the Wilmington family. Serving as the 
centerpiece of the chamber, a dais of Utopian marble rises from 
the floor. Atop it, a semicircular desk of polished glass rests, 
a high-backed wooden chair behind it.

A Utilitarian Hallway~
   This hallway is reminiscent of a very old cave - formed of 
polycrete cast in varying shades of gray. It smells of eons-old 
sweat and chemicals, unmasked by anything but the passage of 
time. There is no interior decoration here, just bare concrete, 
coldly utilitarian. A low mechanical hum - and an occasional 
rattle - persists in the background, seeming to emanate from 
everywhere at once, like a tangible presence in itself. The 
hallway itself leads from the northern security checkpoint to the 
south. To the west, beyond metal double-doors sitting beneath an 
illustration of food packets, the clamor of socializing and 
dining is audible. To the east a reinforced metal doorway sits 
beneath a stencilled "G.B.".

   Sterile and unwelcoming, this bare, concrete room is little 
more than a glorified holding area that has been converted into a 
cafeteria-style dining facility. Lined with rows of long tables 
and utilitarian seating, there are few creature comforts to be 
found save for the ironic presence of what can only be described 
as ambient elevator music punctuated by brief announcements 
relevant to the goings on within the building. #2A large 
portrait#0 portraying #5a gangly, dairk-haired man#0 sits to the 
left of #2a massive#0, #1red-painted 'W'#0 painted upon the 
western wall, while #2a large portrait#0 of #5a wiry, thin-limbed 
older man#0 sits to its right. A single queue leading to a food 
service station snakes along the western wall of the room, 
leading to a long metal counter behind which bored-looking food 
service workers stand ready to dispense meals. 

A magnon-reinforced door is set in the northern wall, a biometric 
scanner installed. You realize with proper permissions, you can

   Framed within carefully crafted faux-wood, intricately etched 
in allowance for a deepened sense of realism, this portrait is 
obviously the product of an incredibly skilled hand. Within the 
depths of the painting, #5a wiry, thin-limbed older man#0 sits in 
a large, brown leather executive chair as he looks slightly to 
the right, his body facing straight forward. A cane rests just 
to the side of the chair, his right hand delicately keeping its 
place upon it while the other adjusts the breast of a dark blue, 
pinstriped suit set atop a crisp, white-collared shirt.

brushstrokes accent even the most minute details upon the 
features of #5a gangly, dark-haired man#0 as he stands next to a 
fireplace, one arm placed atop the mantle while the other is 
extended in welcoming fashion. A cigar in his lips, his mouth is 
curled in an ever-present smile, the warmth of his demeanor 
nearly matching that of the fire set within the fireplace.

An Industrial Kitchen~
   This is a modern, industrial kitchen that would fit into any 
higher end restaurant. Spacious and meticulously organized, it 
is filled with rows of preparation stations, ovens, heat lamps 
and various other implements used in the production of fresh 
food. Each row of equipment is separated by a sienna colored 
tiled floor, allowing easy movement between stations. Though 
obviously designed for the creation of scratch dishes rather than 
prepack, a reconstitution unit, complete with water line and a 
series of microwave ovens are present, sticking out among the 
more traditional food prep appliances like a sore thumb. 
Dominating the north end of the room is a spacious walk-in, home 
to all manner of fresh meat and produce. 

A magnon-reinforced door is set in the southern wall, a biometric 
scanner installed. You realize with proper permissions, you can

A Utilitarian Hallway~
   This hallway is reminiscent of a very old cave - formed of 
polycrete cast in varying shades of gray. It smells of eons-old 
sweat and chemicals, unmasked by anything but the passage of 
time. There is no interior decoration here, just bare concrete, 
coldly utilitarian. A low mechanical hum - and an occasional 
rattle - persists in the background, seeming to emanate from 
everywhere at once, like a tangible presence in itself. Forming 
a 't' intersection, the hallway allows passage in the four 
cardinal directions. To the west an 'F' has been painted above a 
black arrow pointing westward, while a similar arrow points 
eastward with an 'M' painted above it upon the eastern wall.

A Comfortable Dorm Room~
   Light blue plastic paneling has been layered in carefully laid 
strips over the walls and ceiling in this comfortably-spaced room 
containing two bunkbeds on the eastern and western walls, lending 
it an air of calmness. A pastel-colored rug sits atop similar 
paneling which covers the floors beneath, painted in the 
convincing guise of terran marble. A plastic fan whirrs 
overhead, helping to circulate air pushed into the room through a 
ventilation shaft in the ceiling above, seemingly infused with 
the sickly sweet smell of processed air. A single desk sits 
along the northern wall, with #2a well-painted portrait of#0 #5a

keeping watch on the innards of the area.

Elegant, Private Quarters~
   Moonrock intermingled with carefully tiled and textured 
polycrete has been expertly tiled on the floor below, with 
neither chip nor scuff evident upon the faux-granite's 
well-polished surface. Overhead a polyplastic fan whirs quietly, 
pushing aromatic air cooly throughout the room before it 
recirculates into the inlaid vents set into the ceiling above. 
The walls have been carefully painted in artistic strokes, 
creating a mural depicting a hilly terran landscape set around an 
inviting lake, small mammals and birds illustrated sparingly 
throughout. #2A faux-fireplace#0 has been built into the eastern 
wall, with a small switch allowing for it to be turned an off set 
just above a temperature control knob. Upon the fireplace's 
mantle sits #2a small portrait#0 of #5a gangly, dark-haired man#0 
smiling warmly at whomever looks his way.

#5a gangly, dark-haired man#0 looks to the viewer with a friendly

   Scultped polycrete, painted in the hue of a deep mahogany 
wood, frames this faux-fireplace in convincing fashion with two 
greco pillars rising on either side, leading up to a mantle which 
juts out from the wall about a foot and a half. A small screen 
composed of titon-alloy links serves as a barrier between the 
faux-fire itself and those within the quarters beyond. Inside, 
several small projectors have been set into the inner walls of 
the faux-fireplace, which also contains several small faux-wood 
logs stacked atop a metal cradle. When turned on, a small amount 
of dense gas resembling smoke blows from a small vent at the 
bottom as the projector's light mingles within, providing the 
illusion of fire while hot air is pumped in from beyond.

portrait~
   #5A gangly, dark-haired man#0's features have been expertly 
captured in this large portrait, set within a poly-plastic frame. 
Dark brown hair frames his face perfectly, accenting his green 
eyes in a light which could almost be described as angelic. He 
smiles warmly at the unseen viewer, his teeth white and perfectly 
straight betwixt taught cheekbones.

A Utilitarian Hallway~
   This hallway is reminiscent of a very old cave - formed of 
polycrete cast in varying shades of gray. It smells of eons-old 
sweat and chemicals, unmasked by anything but the passage of 
time. There is no interior decoration here, just bare concrete, 
coldly utilitarian. A low mechanical hum - and an occasional 
rattle - persists in the background, seeming to emanate from 
everywhere at once, like a tangible presence in itself. From 
here the hallway continues east. 

#6F.B.#0 has been painted above the doorway to the west, while 
#6F.P.R. 1#0 has been painted above the door to the north, and 
#6F.P.R. 2#0 has been painted above the door to the south.

Elegant, Private Quarters~
   Moonrock intermingled with carefully tiled and textured 
polycrete has been expertly tiled on the floor below, with 
neither chip nor scuff evident upon the faux-granite's 
well-polished surface. Overhead a polyplastic fan whirs quietly, 
pushing aromatic air cooly throughout the room before it 
recirculates into the inlaid vents set into the ceiling above. 
The walls have been carefully painted in artistic strokes, 
creating a mural depicting a sandy beach, encroached upon by the 
turquoise blue water of an expansive ocean. #2A faux-fireplace#0 
has been built into the eastern wall, with a small switch 
allowing for it to be turned an off set just above a temperature 
control knob. Upon the fireplace's mantle sits #2a small 
portrait#0 of #5a gangly, dark-haired man#0 smiling warmly at 
whomever looks his way.

portrait~
   Delicately crafted faux-wood stained the color of a rich, deep 
mahogany frames this incredibly detailed portrait, obviously the 
product of an expert hand. With brown hair groomed in a 
professional and almost presidential manner set atop his head, 
#5a gangly, dark-haired man#0 looks to the viewer with a friendly 
glint in his green eyes, small creases at the edges of his 
eyelids adding a sense of sincerity to his demeanor. His lips 
lift upwards in a confidant smile, his brilliantly white teeth 
flashing like a row of polished dominoes.

fireplace~
   Scultped polycrete, painted in the hue of a deep mahogany 
wood, frames this faux-fireplace in convincing fashion with two 
greco pillars rising on either side, leading up to a mantle which 
juts out from the wall about a foot and a half. A small screen 
composed of titon-alloy links serves as a barrier between the 
faux-fire itself and those within the quarters beyond. Inside, 
several small projectors have been set into the inner walls of 
the faux-fireplace, which also contains several small faux-wood 
logs stacked atop a metal cradle. When turned on, a small amount 
of dense gas resembling smoke blows from a small vent at the 
bottom as the projector's light mingles within, providing the 
illusion of fire while hot air is pumped in from beyond.

A Slightly Humid Latrine Junction~
   A bucket and a brush have been painted above the open frame 
leading from the hallway into an east-west junction here. The 
air is thick and humid here, carrying with it the faint smell of 
chemicals. Polished polycrete tiles compose the floor beneath, 
leading off eastwards towards a small entryway with an 'M' 
painted above it, while a similar entryway to the east has had an 
'F' painted above it.

A Female Latrine~
   The faint sickly sweet smell of cheap perfume lingers in the air within this 
room formed of cheap, textured pink polyprop tiling. Upon the western wall 
sits a row of toilets with comfortably padded, floral-pattern-decorated, seats. 
Large vanity mirrors hang above white, polyprop sinks set into the eastern 
wall. To the south a slight mist and the reek of industrial bleach betrays 
showers beyond.

A Male Latrine~
   Polycrete is set upon the floor beneath caked in an ever-present layer of 
hardened grime composed of dingy grayish-greens and blacks despite scuff marks 
betraying obvious efforts to polish its surface. The reek of industrial bleach 
from the retreated water of the showers to the south rules here, but hints of a 
stale, slightly foul odor lingers in the air here, a mix of sweat, feces and 
humidity. A single row of open toilets, devoid of stalls or privacy of any 
manner, sits upon the eastern edge of the room while sinks have been bolted 
into the west. To the south a spartan shower room can be seen.

Male Showers~
   Four large, metal poles have been set in the polycrete tile from floor to 
ceiling, warm to the touch as a set of four shower heads juts out from each. A 
water spigot is connected to city piping above while a large tank is attached 
with a pull-chain to allow the chemicals within to mix with the water flow. 
The tank label reads, #6"CAUTION: CAUSTIC BLEACH CONCENTRATE"#0 on its side. 
Cramped and borderline uncomfortable, this space is humid and warm, fueled by 
the constant barrage of showers taken by the unclean masses - although how 
clean one can become from a shower of the greyish water that reeks of 
industrial bleach is questionable.

At the Top of a Spartan Stairwell~
   A faintly sweet smell lingers at the top of the staircase 
rising from below, its ascension ending here at the very 
beginnings of a hallway panelled with polished white polyplastic, 
textured below for traction. To the north it appears as if a 
balcony has been converted into some sort of makeshift 
observation post, while the hallway itself leads southwards.

Guard Bunker Overlooking the Market~
   Set upon what appears to originally have been a balcony formed 
of polycrete and metal framing, this area has been converted into 
a reinforced bunker of sorts. Bags filled with moondust and 
rubble have been stacked atop one another, small polycrete blocks 
interspersed within. Hastily welded chrion forms a slit about 
two feet tall and four feet wide, allowing those within to look 
down upon the section of market set before the Wilmington 
Municipal Building, passers by coming and going with little 
awareness of this lofty perch.

A Large, Neutral-Colored Room~
   While the furnishings are finely-made and well-kept, they lack 
color and personalization, instead boasting only neutral tones. 
Plush carpet softens the steps of those walking across it, the 
deep color of it hiding any dirt or mess that might otherwise be 
apparent. There are no windows, the only light that of the lamps 
that have been situated about the office. A single door leads 
out into the hallway in the western direction.

small plant upon its edge, allows passage westward, directly 
across from an ornately crafted doorway to the east.

A Rooftop Greenhouse~
   This enclosed rooftop garden is constructed of clear, 
high-grade polyprop panes set in a titon-alloy frame. Designed 
in the shape of large fractal dome, it houses many deep troughs 
of soil arranged into rows that run the length of the building. 
Water lines run to each trough from a central tank, supplying all 
of the growing organics with a nutrient infused water supply. At 
the center of the structure rests a bank of advanced machinery; a 
water purifyer, irrigation flow-control regulator and climate 
control and monitoring station all designed to replicate and 
maintain an ideal hothouse climate. Also present, though in a 
distinctly smaller quantity, are a quantity of hydroponic farming 
tanks.

A Rooftop Greenhouse~
   The clear dome of polyprop panes and titon-alloy frame allows 
a softened view at the unforgiving sunlight of the lunar days, or 
orange-red expanse of Earth on a backdrop of stars through the 
nights. Below, the air is warm and humid, almost stifling and 
rich with the scent of damp earth and growing plants. Multiple 
troughs of soil and growing greenery line the length of the 
building, with space to walk in between. Along with the control 
center and water purifier, someone has added a slight artsy 
flare: a small fountain off to one side, surrounded by chunks of 
grey moonrock that are positioned out of reach of the water. 
Almost immediately, the water is cycled back into the system, and 
out to the plants.

worse by its confined and windowless nature. Constantly abuzz

area is used to pump and reclaim water from the facility.

function, setting the entire corridor abuzz with a constant, low

itself 'T's off here, allowing for passage east - past a

   Pristine and spacious, this lab houses an abundance of 
research equipment used in the study and manufacture of 
biological and chemical compounds. Work tables are set evenly 
across the floor space, each home to sets of implements designed 
with scientific research in mind. Climate controlled cabinets 
line the walls, each containing various materials, solutions and 
agents used in the research and manufacturing processes carried 
out here. Another area of the room is home to several larger 
pieces of research machinery; a chromatogram, several different 
imaging devices, a centrifuge, spectroscopes and many other 
important devices. Yet another area is devoted to biological 
research and contains dissection stations, specimen holding 
tanks, a DNA sequencer and two autopsy stations.

A Utilitarian Storage Room~
   Drab polycrete walls form the four walls of this cramped 
space, a single light overhead providing adequate light for the 
entire area. A nearly overwhelming odor of chemicals and 
biological compounds fill the windowless area despite an overhead 
vent's continual efforts to suck and circulate air in and from 
the room.

A Slightly Chaotic Robotics Lab~
   The irony of this workroom is that, despite its obvious 
function as a robotics lab, there does not appear to be a single 
operational robot present. All of the work is carried out by 
technicians with tools ranging from primitive to newtek. 
Pristine programming stations complete with complicated 
calibration and diagnostic computers sit directly beside grimy 
workbenches littered with scraps of bot armor, grease and 
disassembled drive mechanisms. Despite the appearance of 
organized chaos, there does not appear to be any spill-over from 
station to station and the technicians present all appear to be 
in sync with one another as projects move seamlessly from stage 
to stage of progress and finally to completion. The floor at the 
far end of the room houses a test area painted in a pattern of 
alternating diagonal yellow and black stripes and surrounded by a 
metal railing.

An Ozone-Scented Workshop~
   The acrid scent of ozone permiates the air of this extremely 
active machine shop. Numerous workstations are manned by plasma 
torch wielding technicians, maintenance crew and artisans busily 
engaged in activities ranging from the repair of complicated 
mechanical devices to the manufacture of firearms. Despite the 
climate control equipment, the heat from the sweltering central 
forge is all but overpowering as it glows white hot among the 
constant activity. The walls are covered in displays ranging 
from blueprints to safety warnings and a bevy of half-completed 
projects, devices in the process of being cannibalized for parts 
and completed projects awaiting final inspection and approval 
occupy large areas of the room.

An Underground Hallway~
   Solid polycrete reinforced by the occassional metal support 
set within the nearby walls gives this corridor a decidedly solid 
feeling, each footstep echo'ing against the unreleting surface 
underfoot. A long, single row of lights shines down in a 
familiar white-blue fluorescent, casting trick shadows throughout 
the surrounding area. Overhead vents, pipes and electrical cords 
combine in a twisted entanglement of utility and space-saving 
function, setting the entire corridor abuzz with a constant, low 
hum. From here the corridor continues north while #9a large 
'X'#0 has been painted above the southern doorway.

A Chilled Server Room~
   Spartan and unadorned, this cramped, climate controlled room 
houses banks of computer servers, all humming in a low, 
sub-audible drone as they record, backup and transmit data. The 
majority of the room is dominated by a massive mainframe computer 
that serves as the nerve center of the complex, with all of the 
building's major functions routed through and tied into it. A 
large bank of monitors resides above the mainframe, suspended 
from the ceiling in a semi-circle, and allowing the operator 
access to an endless stream of data, indecipherable to any but 
those with a trained eye. The only other features of note are 
the purposefully obtrusive security cameras in each corner of the 
room.

An Polycrete Courtyard Before the Wilmington Headquarters~
   High polycrete walls topped by razor-wire surround this courtyard which 
seems almost entirely functional in nature, composed of little more than a 
large section of flattened earth with gritty polycrete poured atop, marred by 
the passage of people and time. In the center of the courtyard stands #2a 
tall, metal flagpole#0 which bears #2a large, black flag marked in the center 
with a#0 #1red 'W'#0. A solid metal-gate sits to the north, either restricting 
or allowing access for the throngs of people which come and go. Likewise, to 
the south, a large three-story building constructed of moonrock and polycrete 
rises up, a set of metal double-doors dominant upon the building's northern 
face. Just to the right of the southern doorway a #2well-crafted plaque#0 has 
been bolted into the polycrete. 

To the west, a long, narrow building has been marked above its entryway with a 
large, red cross. To the south, the metal doors look to have been recently 
reinforced with magnon bars and a #2biometric handscanner#0 has been bolted to 
the wall. Above it is a small metal plaque that reads #1Authorized Wilmington 
Personnel Only#0.

A Dreary Communications Room~
   Dingy polycrete walls compose the four sides of this room, the 
burnishes and pockmarks inherent within undoubtedly indicative of 
recycled materials and their previous uses. The air within 
smells almost chemically stale, a feature made all the more 
cumbersome by the constant noise buzzing about the walls from the 
nearby utility rooms. Sound within the room itself seems to thud 
dully against the walls as the lights overhead do little to 
lighten the mood. 

#2A small intercom pad#0 has been set into the eastern wall, 
which you realize allows you to #6PRESS INTERCOM#0 followed by

A Neat, Respectable Office~
   This room, though of no great size, appears spacious due to a 
lack of things to fill it. The floor is made of square metal 
tiles, which lends a sterile feeling to the room. This is 
softened somewhat by the plush yellow rug in the center of the 
room, upon which rests a stark metal desk. The walls in this 
room are a plum color, artistically applied to give variation in 
the depth of the color. Upon the wall opposite the door is #2a 
large, stylized golden yellow 'W'#0 that crowns #2a portrait of#0 
#5a gangly, dark-haired man#0. The room is brightly lit, and all

A Sterile Infirmary~
   This long and narrow building has been constructed of 
tightly-fitting bricks made of moon-rock. To be more 
aesthetically pleasing, however, the interior walls have been 
coated with white plastic textured to look like plastic. The 
floor is composed of tightly-fitting white polyprop tiles, 
helping to achieve the room's look of both bright and sterile. 
Sheets of clear, translucent plastic hang from the ceiling to 
divide the evenly-spaced cots throughout the room, which do 
little for privacy except perhaps blurring the view. Arranged in 
a semicircle above the door is the word "INFIRMARY" along with 
the image of a red cross. Set beside the northern door is a 
biometric reader, which one could use to #6HANDSCAN NORTH#0.

An Underground Stairwell~
   Solid polycrete reinforced walls end abruptly here, leading to a dimly lit 
stairwell, recently constructed from melded alloys. The hallways gleams with 
light back towards the east but there is a hushed tone set here, the visibility 
lowered and quiet whispers coming from below barely reaching up to the entrance 
of the descent. Along the far wall a very thick and bulky set of conduits 
drop, along with dark-blue plumbing, giving the impression that although 
secluded, this section is alive with activity. White lab coats are about the 
only noticeable article of clothing worn by anyone venturing this far into the 
labs. The stairwell leads down into the depths, the lighting too low to lend 
much vision as to what's there. Back towards the east is more artificial 
lighting and footsteps, the dull chatter of less reserved technicians.

In an Old, Cluttered Truck Bed~
   This truck was likely pulled out of retirement, and the bed reflects this. 
Considerable wear and tear makes occupation somewhat hazardous, with edges that 
have been worn sharp or loose screws threatening to snag garments. Battered 
boxes and other assorted junk litters the floor, even stacked waist-high in 
corners, while a series of metal footlockers have been chained to the sides 
below the railing of the bed to serve as makeshift benches. A heavily 
scratched plexiglass window allows a blurry look into the cabin, and below is a
