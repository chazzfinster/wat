A Messy Warehouse~
   Set firmly onto the edge of the market square, this warehouse 
stretches out long and wide, allowing a large number of people to 
crowd in at the same time - participants, spectators, and other 
traffic that flows from the marketplace, all filtering through 
the warhouse-turned-arena. Contrary to the look on the outside, 
this warehouse is fairly well-constructed, with sturdy walls and 
support beams and actually intact windows, here and there. The 
floors are covered in all manner of trash and the walls are 
scratched and marred, giving the place an altogether messy 
appearance. 
   Amidst the semi-controlled chaos is a betting booth, situated 
on the western wall, near the hallway that leads onwards. A 
golden coin is painted onto the wall above it, so as to prevent 
confusion. Southwards stretches another hallway.

A Sheet-Metal Hallway and Viewing Room~
   This hallway is wide and crudely-constructed - it is a 
sheet-metal addition to the eastern warehouse, branching off and 
moving on westwards. The floor, starting just at the hallway's 
beginning, is steel mess, bent downwards from the constant 
trampling underfoot. Below are are two cramped, bloodstained 
rooms - the fighting pits, the one-on-one arenas - and the floor 
is kept fairly clean, so as to allow the viewing of the 
combatants below. A metal spiral stair leads up to a door above.

A Spectator's Room~
   This wide room does just barely enough to protect people from 
the elements - with walls and roof of rivetted sheet metal and a 
floor of wired steel mesh, it is created for a single sole 
purpose: Entertainment. While wide, the amount of people that 
cram into this room can make it seem particularly crowded, and 
the mesh floor often buckles dangerously beneath the weight of 
the spectators. Below the mesh can be seen the bloodstained rock 
of the arena floor. In the exact middle of the floor is a simple 
steel trapdoor, opening to a hacked stairway.

VIP Lounge~
   Furnished comfortably, this lounge looks to be perhaps the 
single most expensive space in the entirety of the warehouse. 
The floor is covered in woven lizard skin, acting as a sort of 
carpet. From floor to sheet-metal ceiling, the four walls of 
this room are thick glass, scratched a bit but uncracked, 
providing a full view of the large arena around it. From here, 
any spectators could watch combatants rip each other to pieces 
from mere inches away, themselves perfectly safe.

The Betting Booths~
   Considerably cleaner than the warehouse from which it 
branches, this small room is kept fairly spartan. A trapdoor is 
set into the south-end of the floor, and just to the left of that 
trapdoor is a booth, and painted along either side are large 
warriors that stand at attention, facing the crowds; one is 
painted red and the other is painted blue.

A Dirty Operating Room~
   This small room consists of two operating tables, both of them 
rusty and stained, and an incredibly dirty sink. The stone 
beneath the tables has been dyed a dark brown from perhaps 
gallons of blood, and the stains lead back and forth from those 
to the aforementioned sink. A lone, bare lightbulb flickers in 
the center of the room, providing a dim yellow that casts lengthy 
shadows.

crudely painted across its surface.

An Expansive Arena With a Low Ceiling~
   With a ceiling of steel mesh, sunken in places from spectators 
above, this arena is a fairly large, hacked out square. The 
walls and floor are rough, jagged stone, splattered with old 
bloodstains, spit, sweat, and dust. Bare lightbulbs hang 
randomly about, often low enough to be right in the faces of 
fighters, and many of these are broken, the glass long since 
pounded to dust. In the very center of the killing ground sits a 
box made entirely of thick, scratched, bulletproof glass, and 
within that is a fairly comfortable-looking lounge.

Entrance to the Tunnels~
   An ancient metal ladder stretches down from the maintenance 
hole above to the floor of this narrow utility tunnel, firmly 
anchored in the polycrete. The bare walls here are tight, barely 
allowing room for more than a small group to stand abreast. The 
ceiling is low, forcing anyone taller than average to stoop down 
to avoid striking their head on the polycrete. To the west, the 
tunnel continues on a straight course toward a junction of 
tunnels, while above the sky is visible through the open 
maintenance hole.

bare of any cables or utilities, only the odd metal bracket 
remains as a reminder of the purpose of these tunnels. Westward, 
a junction in the tunnels approaches, while eastward a ladder 
leading upward stands beneath a shaft of light from the surface.

   The various utility tunnels come together to join at this 
cramped junction. The space here is hardly big enough for any 
group to stand comfortably, the bare polycrete looming on all 
sides. To the west is a closed utility door, a small electronic 
pad looking to have been bolted crudely to the polycrete wall 
beside it, permitting authorized individuals to #6HANDSCAN 
WEST#0. From above the door several thick pipes and thinner 
cables snake out, branching off both to the north and south over 
stretches of yet more claustrophobic tunnels. To the east, a 
small shaft of light can be seen over a distant ladder that leads 
to the surface.

A Tunnel Between a Utility Station and Junction~
   The polycrete ceiling of this cramped tunnel is a maze of 
pipes and cables that stretch between the utility station to the 
west and the junction to the east, passing over the heavy utility 
door. The bare walls are close together, making movement 
difficult at best. Audible is the hum of machinery from the 
west, while the air is thick with a dank humidity. To the east 
stands a heavy utility door, a small panel looking to have been 
bolted into the polycrete beside it, allowing those able to

An Expansive Utility Plant~
   The loud hum of machinery and pumps reverberates off the 
polycrete walls here, while the air has become think with a dank 
humidity. The utility plant extends over the entire length of 
the nearly four meter wide room, a mass of pumps, relays, and 
machinery. A maze of both intake and outtake pipes snake from 
the plant, rising up to the ceiling where they join a twisting 
collection of ducts and cables before snaking off to the east. A 
small metal ladder stands in one corner of the plant, rising to a 
closed access-hatch in the ceiling.

cracked remains of the polycrete wall to the south and the floor

Steep Rubble Sloping Downward Into the Crater~
   This near vertical field of blackened and fused glass traces a 
curving path along the shattered remains of buildings overhead, 
thick sections of polycrete overhanging. To the north, the 
crater continues to curve along its path, cutting into the 
remains of a street before being halted at the sagging remains of 
the perimeter. To the east, the crater continues deeper, before 
leveling off and beginning its rise again on the other side, 
while to the south the shattered remains of a utility tunnel are 
visible skirting along the edge of the crater.

Northern Edge of a Crater~
   The sagging, blackened wall of the perimeter leans 
precariously over the area, the ground fused together into a 
field of cracked black glass. To the east and the west, the 
crater wall rises to meet the remains of the streets that once 
passed through this area, while to the south the crater levels 
into a shallow bowl.

walls on all sides. To the north, the sagging wall of the 
perimeter hands over the crater, while to the east and west the 
walls of the crater rise up to meet the remains of buildings that 
survived whatever happened here. To the south, a section of 
tunnel has been exposed, skirting around the edge of the crater.

Steep Wall of the Crater~
   This near vertical field of shattered and blackened glass 
traces along a curving cutaway of the ruined buildings above, 
little more than rubble at this point. To the west the crater 
deepens, before leveling off and rising once more to meet the 
ruins on the other side. To the south, the remains of a 
shattered utility tunnel are easily visible, while to the north 
the broken form of the perimeter seems to sag overhead.

Sloping Rubble Within a Crater~
   The crater here is sloping from the rim of the ruined street above into the 
shallow bowl that has been carved from the landscape by whatever catastrophe 
occurred. The wall of the crater has been blackened and fused into a cracked 
field of glass, a lip of broken asphalt bordering the top section. To the 
west, the crater wall continues to sweep along, the perimeter buckled in 
several places, while to the south the remains of a utility tunnel are set into 
the crater wall.

   The tunnels to the south seem to be made of a slightly older 
polycrete, stained somewhat more by the passage of time.

Cramped Tunnel Near a Hatch~
   A heavy, rusted hatch stands along the northern side of this 
cramped room, a small handscan panel set into the wall beside it. 
The room itself is barely two meters wide, consisting of bare 
polycrete that has been stained and cracked in places. In the 
midst of the room is a metal ladder with textured rungs, leading 
down through a narrow hole in the floor. There is a sharp smell 
of sewage here, likely emanating from a shattered pipe that runs 
over the northern hatch.

find their way out of the utility station. On one wall, a heavy 
utility door has been painted a dull-yellow, the paint chipping 
to expose the alion metal beneath. In the western corner of the 
room, there is a small textured ladder that leads to a small 
utility hatch above.

Tunneling Festooned With Propaganda~
   Taking up the majority of the walls of this part of the metro is crude and 
messy #2propaganda#0, from painted images to nailed posters, they cover nearly 
the whole section of the line. Many of them covering older faded ones. In 
places scorch marks have cut long, thick lines of blackened matter along the 
walls. The tracks are for the most part undamaged, with only the same 
blackened scorches that the walls share. Puddles and murky pools gather in 
places, in dips and dives on the uneven floor. The light fixtures have long 
since ceased to work with only some of them giving a sharp crackling retort 
when exposed to water.

propaganda~
Written in crude inks and an even cruder hand the majority of
he posters are of a pro-human nation with many reading #1BURN THE MUTANT!#0
and other such slogans.  Very old, many of them are little more than
faded remains, the color having leeched completely out of the material.

Some, clearly made to last longer, have withered time better and can
still be read by a keen on #1TEN FINGERS TEN TOES, OTHERWISE IT GOES!#0 being
one of the more light hearted and predominant ones.

A final ugly drawing shows something of a face besieged by tentacles, through
it, an ugly scorch mark has been applied.

Beside An Upturned Metro Cart~
   Taking up the majority of this section of the tunnel is an upturned metro 
carriage, turned fully on to its roof in the narrow confines of the ceiling. 
It rests at an angle, going fully across both sections of track. Despite its 
old and ruined exterior, and its situation of being upside down, telltale signs 
of life still show. Two colors flash from inside the paneling one #1red#0 and 
another #2green#0, they sit outside its buckled slide doors. Around the 
outside of the shattered cart, cracks and splits in the rock walling are seen, 
some done by extreme force. In an attempt to cover them, extensive graffiti 
and propaganda has been sprawled over most available surfaces, in reds, blacks 
and greens, easily catching any light passing over them.

Along Buckled Metro Lines~
   The dual rail lines of this part of the track are heavily buckled and 
twisted. Running briefly straight, they quickly begin to weave heavily back 
and forth until they have come free of their fastenings. In the worst 
afflicted area, thick, black scorch marks seem to be the culprit. On the 
curved walls, more of the telltale gun marks leave their mark, with 
micro-tiling having been blown off completely. Other than that, the tunnel is 
as the rest with the curved metallic ceiling and the once ornate uprights and 
stanchions.

Crumbled Section Of Flooded Tunnel~
   Cutting off the end of this tunnel is a heavy cave in, tonnes of metal and 
hard stone having fell through and blocked off further passage in its entirety. 
As the tunnel meets the foot of the rubble, a large pool of polluted water has 
gathered with a shinning surface of scummy filth. Of the rubble and metal 
itself, a dozen pin prick leaks squirt out the same liquid increasing the size 
of the pool at a tiny rate. While one track runs straight under the heavy 
rockface, the other has been bent back with its end abruptly stopping midpoint 
in the air. The all pervading stench of contaminated water is especially 
strong here.

Sloping Rails Of The Metro Line~
   Square in shape, this section of tunneling and rails is relatively intact 
save for some buckling of the tracks. The moss-covered walls of the tunnel are 
chipped and smashed in places but far less than the rest. Stuck, pinned and 
otherwise taking up space on them are various posters and pictures each 
displaying the others counterargument. As the rails level off from the east 
they head in a direct route straight ahead. Overhead, the blocky outline of 
maintenance hatches and access panels take shape, their grills and intakes 
packed full of age-old filth. In these parts, the bio-fungus grows in swarms, 
clustered around the venting and its effluence.

Half Sunken Rail Lines~
   Sloping steadily downwards in to the ground below, this broken length of 
train rail descend downwards in to a thick pool of scummy water. The source of 
which evident from the leaking crack in the rounded ceiling above. Dribbling 
out, faster than a leak, is a narrow stream of brackish water. Both lines of 
the train system go down in tandem in to the dark liquid , lost in its murky 
depths. The smell of the pool is rancid and strong, with only the steady 
stream from above breaking the silence and the surface. Further west, the 
lines continue down their slope but at a lesser angle.

Inside the Fortified Remains Of an Upturned Carriage~
   Heavily cannibalized of anything of comfort, the ruined interior of this 
once functioning cab has been retrofitted in its entirety in to a more 
defendable location. All the windows have at one point been shattered, in 
their place heavy boarding has been nailed. As the outside shows, the carriage 
is still upside down with the rusted metal seating above on the ceiling. All 
over the walls, patchwork repairs have been made. The most obvious being the 
copious amount of boarding hammered over large cluster of holes. In several 
places, slogans and propaganda have been scrawled over available places, all of

A Blocked Track-way~
   The track here comes to a sudden stop as the entirety of the western end is 
completely sealed off by debris. The impassable terrain is littered with 
mostly dirt, but upon closer inspection seems to actually be sediment. The 
tracks are completely splayed and ripped apart, the alloy brittle from 
metal-fatigue, jutting into the ruined wall of desecrated polycrete.

Tracks Nearing A Dead End~
   The tracks continue along in drab display in the square shaped tunnel. 
Despite a few tarnishings here and there, the metal is mostly intact. The 
polycrete walls have been cracked in spider-web fashion in some places. The 
damages being worse in some areas ranging to indentions in the walls' surfaces 
ranging from fist-sized holes to craters that seemingly threaten to buckle. 
Graffiti decks the slate-gray in a frantic manner, unreadable beneath the caked 
on dust.

The Tunnel Continues~
   The tunnel here appropriates an overhead passage that follows the length of 
the spanse. The loose structure barely holds to the ceiling and is just large 
enough for a small man to enter, though the missing bolts in the supports over 
an ideal that it would likely fall if any attempt were made. Heading westward 
the shaft suddenly ends with the remaining pieces scattered about the floor 
over the corroded tracks. The pathway is littered with debris and certainly 
holds no grounds for notable exploration.

Metro Tunnel Stretching East to West~
   Scaffolds line the ceiling here as well as a large amount of circuitry 
wires. The wires themselves, insulated with a black coating, have been 
re-wired and taped so many times that they barely hold any symbolism of their 
former purpose. Slathered about the support beams, the wires hang like a 
gutted snake, remnant of a more useful past. The tracks below them are mangled 
and ruined with the polycrete bearing multiple fractures and with further 
investigation, proves that the cause lies with the corroded support-bars 
inside.

Bend in the Metro Tunnel~
   Contouring with the curvature of the polycrete walls are brown stains that 
run perpendicular of the tracks. The material deteoriated drastically, the 
walls bearing condensation and notably cold to the touch. Behind the walls lie 
a soft drone that matches with the trickling water that leaks from the cracks 
in an eerie way. The liquid drains over the painted surface of the walls, 
surreal designs that are all that remains of distant portraitive display.

The Metro Continues~
   The ceiling of the tunnel has a single, cylindrical bar that runs along it's 
surface that has coiled wire about it. The wires connects to light fixtures 
that have long since been shattered and destroyed. The top of the tunnel being 
a half-circle that connects to otherwise flat walls which are covered in small 
white tiles. The tiles are missing in some areas in large patches, fallen to 
the tunnel floor and shattered. Along the side of the tracks here is a raised 
platform with accompanying railing.

A Curve in the Tunnel~
   The polycrete slabs lining the walls have grown to become misaligned over 
time, becoming jagged and uneven like crooked teeth. Some slabs lean on slight 
angles, while a few have given way, buckling or snapping in half to have the 
top of the slab smother the railway line beneath. To the north and east the 
beaten metro line continues, the tracks being consumed by the darkness 
presiding over the tunnel, while a drone of the wind can be heard howling in 
the distance.

anti-mutant propaganda, posters and paintings fight for real estate in patches 
along the tunnel wall, which is often pocked and marred by small arms fire and 
fragmentation damage. The rusty chrion tracks stretch on into the darkness, 
mostly visible beneath gravel strewn unevenly across the tunnel floor, though 
in some places they are damaged, destroyed or missing completely.

   The polycrete walls of the metro tunnel have seen better days, having been 
pocked and chipped in sections by gunfire. Bundles of ruined cabling stretch 
along the walls, undertaking twists and turns, and at times circling back on 
itself. The tracks themselves are in a state of disrepair here, the portions 
still uncovered by dirt having buckled and twisted in some places. Hanging

them shattered despite the metal cage installed around them to protect the

At a Cave-In along the Metro Tunnel~
   Here the cylindrical ceiling of the metro tunnel has suffered a partial 
collapse. A section of polycrete has succombed to the pressure over the years, 
and has crumbled inward, causing tonnes of dirt and broken polycrete to spill 
over the railway tracks here. Twisted chrion reinforcement bars stick up from 
the rubble like spears, making it difficult to progress. Movement is further 
restricted as travellers must not only scale the small mountain of debris but 
also squeeze through a small semi-circular gap in the top of the tunnel to 
proceed.

A Scrubbed, Spartan Room~
   Formed of polycrete that has withstood some of the test of time, this room 
is still beginning to show wear and tear. Old cables and pipes line the walls, 
but not as much as the utility tunnel outside. It appears that if someone has 
had new flooring laid down, which is kept impeccably clean, and the walls have 
been scrubbed and painted a pale grey after the cracks were filled in. To the 
south, a door allows passage back into the utility tunnels with a small control 
panel operating it.

At a Junction in the Metro~
   With the main tunnel spanning in from the west, this underground junction 
splits the tracks into three separate directions. Each tunnel departs in a 
gentle curve into the darkness, with the rusted chrion tracks intersecting in 
some parts as they each meander toward their respective tunnels. A single 
track switch can be seen off to the side of the main track, the lever snapped 
off at the hinge point. The continuous drone of the distant wind can be heard 
quite clearly here.

Section of Utility Tunnel~
   Bare polycrete walls loom on all sides of this cramped section 
of utility tunnel, each surface cool to the touch. Thick pipes 
and ancient cabling snake overhead, bolted securely to ceiling. 
The surface underfoot is rough and uneven, careful inspection 
revealing the packed down surface of refuse that has built up 
over time. A thick layer of dust has settled over every surface, 
while the air itself is musty and stale.

Metro Tunnel Running North to South~
   To the south the curve in the railway ends to straighten and head north in a 
steady decline. The tunnel stretches onward into the darkness of the 
underground system, though a set of dimly glowing lights flicker on a panel 
mounted high on the tunnel wall alongside the track. One #2green#0 light 
remains on, while the #1red#0 bulb beneath it flickers at irregular intervals, 
suggesting a fault in the circuitry.

An Aged Underground Tunnel~
   The dilapidated metro tunnel is largely unremarkable here. What is visible 
of the dust-coated polycrete walls is marked with faded anti-mutant propaganda. 
Most of the painted posters are simple and to the point, with multi-limbed 
mutant silhouettes being central in a red circle with a large diagonal cross 
through the centre. Another features a stoic astronaut pointing outward at the 
presumed reader, with the words '#3Mutants and YOU#0' in bold letters beneath 
it, however the fine text beneath it has blurred over the years and is hardly 
readable.

marks can be seen along the polycrete walls here, likely from a metro train 
grinding by at speed along the curve. Above the suspended cabling has been 
severed and left in loose coils amongst the gravel.

   The tunnel here dilates wide as it yields to a second track, which splits 
directly from the main for a duration of one hundred metres before rejoining 
it. The brief split in the tracks is separated by a island platform which is 
littered with scraps of train parts and debris, the rubble having been combed 
for anything useful more than once. To the north and south of the repair track 
the metro flanges back to the single cylindrical tunnel.

The walls here are mostly bare of graffiti, though there are some more recent 
dark brown stains which appear to be dried blood, spattered along the eastern 
wall in lengthy streaks and handprints. The main metro line continues north at 
a slight descent, while through the western tunnel, the howling drone of the

Metro Tunnel Descends into Murky Water~
   The metro tracks here descends rather steeply to plunge into a body of 
viscous, acrid-smelling water, which completely submerges the tunnel. The 
surface of the water itself is covered with a film of oil, which is evident 
from the myriad of colours which reflect when a light source is directed upon 
it. The ancient tunnel has been disturbed more recently, which is evident 
through the drag marks and blood stains marring the dirt alongside the tracks 
leading to the water. The occasional claw mark is gouged into the wall of the 
tunnel, the scratching trailing northward and usually ending in a bloodied 
fingernail or two lodged in the polycrete.

Waterlogged Tunnel~
   Completely submerged, the viscous liquid that doubles as water bathes the 
curved polycrete walls and straight solid floor. To the north, a large pile of 
rubble blocks out any exit deeper into the water and effectively truncates the 
tracks that move from south to north. Most of the track is so rusted and 
pitted that even if this space were drained, it'd be hopelessly damaged for 
further use. Clumps of spine-tipped moss grows over the shattered underwater 
scene, peeking out from between some of the larger chunks of broken polycrete. 
Visibility is poor even if the darkness wasn't all consuming, as the murky 
depths run brown with pollution and oil.

Tracks Beneath a Trashed Metro Station~
   Stretching to the east and west, the metro tunnel plunges into the darkness, 
though the polycrete curve of the northern wall yields to an underground metro 
platform. A set of narrow maintenance stairs lead up onto the platform from 
the trackway beneath it. Laying amongst the dirt, the rusted chrion rails 
split apart to lead further westward, beyond the station. The ghastly howling 
of a wind source can be heard from the platform above.

A Metro Tunnel Blocked by Wreckage~
   The curved tunnel stretching to the west is completely blocked off by metro 
train wreck. Consumed by flames and left to rust over the years, little 
remains apart from the rusted chrion skeleton of the carts. The train itself 
looks to have derailed whilst undertaking the sweeping curve of the track, 
having come to rest on its side. The tracks themselves have been yanked from 
their mounting points from the impact, leaving the metal rails spearing outward 
into the air in opposite directions. 

The tunnel ceiling has been torn open here, most likely with the use of large 
amounts of explosive judging by the extensive damage and scorch marks marring 
the polycrete.

Metro Tunnel Spanning East to West~

touch, and sprawl toward the arched ceiling of the tunnel. Crude graffiti, 
anti-mutant propaganda, posters and paintings fight for real estate in patches 
along the tunnel wall, which is often pocked and marred by small arms fire and 
fragmentation damage. The rusty chrion tracks stretch on into the darkness,

in some places they are damaged, destroyed or missing completely.

Abandoned Metro Tunnel~
   The straight section of underground tunnel stretches as far as the eye can 
see here in each direction, before it is consumed by darkness. Ancient 
anti-mutant propaganda and graffiti fight for real-estate on the polycrete 
walls, some of the faded markings stretching as high as the curve of the tunnel 
ceiling. Cabling sprouts from the southern wall here, running parallel to the 
tracks until it meets a beaten metal fusebox. The fusebox itself has been left 
ajar, the innards torn out long ago, with the lid itself marked with graffiti.

The Metro Continues~
   Rusted pipes line the ceiling of this desolate curved tunnel, leading 
southward towards a fork. The chrion tracks are littered with rust, some rails 
missing entirely, making it improbable for a train to travel with any real 
success if there were a train to be had. Inset blocks of moon rock zig-zag 
through polycrete and several dim unlit lights line the curved walls. Shadows 
shroud most of the area, cloaking a few piles of loosely gathered bones here 
and there at the corners created by sloped walls meeting the leveled-off 
floors. The faint musk of mold hangs in the air though the evidence of it 
shows only in the cracks of broken faux stone.

Nearing a Bend in the Metro~
   Nearing a bend in this tunnel, the space bears a marked curve upwards from a 
mostly level floor, sloping towards an arched center. Though crafted largely 
of polycrete, decorative inlay of cut moon stone creates simple geometric 
patterns. Chrion tracks follow the floor. No hint of shine remains on the 
metallic surface as time and rust have eaten away at much of it, leaving a 
pocked and useless surface. Inset into the curved walls are powerless 
rectangles that once served as illumination.

A Bend in the Metro Tunnel~
   Contouring with the curvature of the polycrete walls are brown stains that 
run perpendicular of the tracks. The material deteoriated drastically, the 
walls bearing condensation and notably cold to the touch. Behind the walls lie 
a soft drone that matches with the trickling water that leaks from the cracks 
in an eerie way. The liquid drains over the painted surface of the walls, 
surreal designs that are all that remains of distant portraitive display.

spared as they hang shredded from the ceiling and walls. The chrion tracks are 
intact here as they curve in sync with the tunnel, despite being covered in a 
light layer of gravel and dust.

At a Collapsed Section of Tunnel~
   A vast mass of debris has been jammed into this section of tunnel with the 
intent of making an impassable barricade, though this has evidently failed, 
judging by it's current condition. The intial effort to close the tunnel seems 
to have been a large amount of explosive, judging by the scorch marks and 
fragmentation damage peppering the walls. Despite these efforts, debris and 
and chunks of polycrete have been thrown outward in all directions from the 
barricade, as if something rather large has smashed through the barricade like 
a battering ram, though the wall of rubble has collapsed in the wake of the 
intruder. The wind howls relentlessly through the small gaps in the debris.

only and constant sound remaining after it's abandonment. #6Chrion tracks#0

By a Knocked Out Armoured Vehicle~
   Dominating this turn in the metro is the burnt-out husk of what appears to 
be an armoured assault mech. Once a pinnacle of mechanized might, the vehicle 
is now nothing but a severely rusted tomb resting on a pile of gravel. The 
armoured sides are pocked and cratered by what appears to have been rocket and 
small arms fire, and little remains of the tracks that once propelled it. The 
turret has been left traversed toward the bridge, with the turret ring torn 
apart by an explosion, which was evidently internal judging by the way the 
rusted shards of armour flay outward at an awkward angle. The barrel appears 
to be aiming toward the darkness shrouding the opposite side of the bridge, 
though it is difficult to tell as it's length is split outward from tip to 
turret.

A Girder Bridge Spanning an Underground Chasm~
   Spanning the width of a gigantic underground cavern, this polycrete 
supported girder bridge has been ravaged and annihilated by all manners of 
warfare. At the halfway point of of the bridge a massive crater in the 
polycrete from what appears to been an explosion, with the metal rails twisted 
and hanging loosely in the air. A set of graffiti-riddled metro cars have been 
derailed near the crater, having smashed through the barriers to send the train 
cascading over the edge. The last three cars of the train hold their 
deteriorated couplings still, leaving the remainder of the carriages hanging 
mid-air above the dark abyss of the cavern.

West of a Wartorn Bridge~
   This area is littered with decaying mats on eitherside of the tracks along 
it's polycrete walkways. They are covered in rust colored splatter marks and 
pool shapes beneath them of equal hue. Between each is a rack of curtains 
covered in the same brownish-red splotches. Along the tracks are rows of crude 
barriers made from refuse that has been heaped and stacked together together. 
Along some of them are weapon ports and cavities, the exterior of which has 
been riddled with bullet holes and fragmentation damage.

The gradually disintegrated bolts presumably wittled down by the small trickle 
of water that leaks from the cracks in the polycrete. On the floor of the 
tunnel are a sparse amount of skeletons, frozen in their final moments of 
sprawling southward. Most of them that are still intact bear shattered bones 
with center-fractures.

end-to-end made of rusted alloy sheets. They are dingy and barely hold under 
their own weight, riddled with bulletholes of all shapes and sizes. Along 
their tops are crudely wound wires with spikes driven through the top of the 
makeshift fencing. Laying directly in the center of the walls is an opening 
that has been lined with skeletal remains, their destroyed weapons still in the 
clutches of their bone appendages.

platform is now utterly trashed. Rubbish and debris are strewn across the 
tiled floor, and the revolving metal cages filtering access have been snapped, 
broken and bent out of shape long ago, leaving the platform accessible to 
anyone. A handful of gutted ticket booths are aligned just beyond the cages, 
through the transparent plastic barriers of each has been smashed in with 
force, with all the equipment inside stolen many years back by the looks of the 
dust and debris settled within. To the north is a wide corridor which leads to 
a stairwell, while to the south the platform ends abruptly, yielding to the 
metro trackway below.

cramped to say the least. The hatch above is made from tarnished chrion, with 
many scratches lining the broken locking handle from wear and tear over the 
years. Massive cracks line the concrete walls, and the floor is utterly 
filthy. Plastic crates of assorted sizes have been scattered over the room, 
while a few crusty, padded matts have been laid down in one corners. 

More recently, droplets and streaks of blood have stained the metal ladder in 
places, with a bloodied handprint smeared across the hatch. A section of the 
wall has collapsed on the southern wall, the collapse leading to a tunnel 
below.

was purpose-built for the use of hundreds of commuters at once. The polycrete 
stairs are chipped and broken in places, while the walls are coated in a dull 
green paint which is intermittently disturbed by faded graffiti. Midway down 
this section of stairwell, a large arch opens up to the south, leading to a 
vast hallway beyond. Debris and rubbish is strewn across the ground, while a 
bullethole riddled sign hangs from the ceiling, though the words upon it have

the stairwell from water below. Among the rusty items jammed into place are 
cabinents, bins, burnt-out equipment which is reinforced by scavenged lengths 
of chrion railway tracks which have been propped against the barrier to keep it 
in place. A door is set along the north side of the stairwell, which is

A Yawning Metro Station~
   This cavernous chamber sprawls into the darkness to the east and west. The 
walls and ceiling are one due to the horizontal hemicylindrical shape of the 
station. Concave spheres delve into the polycrete to the north and south, for 
what appears to have once been shops and stalls, though now each of them are 
gutted and empty. A sheer amount of rubbish, debris and discarded equipment 
litters the ground here in heaps, with the floor beneath it all is slick with 
foul-smelling water. Bullet holes riddle the polycrete in places, water 
dribbling from within some of them to trickle down the wall. Set in the centre 
of the massive chamber is the top of a staircase, which is flanked by rusted 
metal railings which were intended to prevent anyone from falling down them. 
The western end of the station has been blocked off by a massive collapse in 
the underground system, a vast amount of rubble now blocking progress in that 
direction.

   Once orderly and efficient, this massive circular room is now in a state of 
ruin. The northern quadrant of the room was once designated to security 
surveillance, judging by the number of smashed and looted computer shells which 
still remain against the wall. The southern quadrant of the room is lined with 
hastily-built racks bolted to the wall, the contents of which were raided long 
ago. In the centre of the room is an overturned round table, while scattered 
elsewhere are the metal chairs belonging to it. The alion security hatch is 
similar to a vault door, with a locking mechanism operated by a small wheel to 
lock the hatch in place. Among the trash and debris are signs of inhabitants, 
ranging from blood stains to makeshift bed mats scattered over the ground.

   The hallway tunnel running from the main corridor of the metro station is 
only short in length, ending with a solid polycrete wall. Doors are set within 
the eastern and western walls, toilet signs, both male and female, set upon 
each one. There is a vast amount of graffiti on the female door, the most 
recent bearing the large words '#6OUT OF ORDER#0', which are accompanied by a 
crudely drawn picture of a large crocodile with its jaws open as it prepares to 
eat a stick figure sitting on a toilet. The stick figure is drawn with a wide 
open mouth, which is evidently the artist's attempt to portray surprise.

torn from the wall. Mirrors which once lined the walls have all been smashed 
into shards. A narrow corridor runs north from the washroom, which is lined 
with cramped cubicles. Most of the cubicles have an alloy toilet centered 
within them, though most of the cubicle walls have been punched through and 
broken. Graffiti is scattered along the tiles, some of which have been smashed 
from the wall altogether.
