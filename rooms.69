Bottom of the Lower Spire~
   The eastern section of this area has been heavily damaged, a gaping hole 
giving access to a recessed hatch that seems to have forced itself into the 
structure. The original purpose of this area is lost, though the deep-blue 
metal of the walls seems to press down on any who pass through here. Small 
hexagonal plates make up almost every surface, thin lines of a quartz-like 
material serving as a barrier between one plate and the next. Each is almost 
perfectly flush with its neighbor, though every few meters a single plate has 
jutted our from the others. No visible lights can be seen, the passage seeming 
almost bare.

Bottom of a Deep Shaft~
   The floor here suddenly changes to a quartz material, extending for several 
meters in all directions before ending against the small blue hexagonal panels 
of the walls. The quartz seems to be thick, extending underfoot down toward 
faint blue-tinged holograms that are just visible, glimmering through the 
material. The air here is thick with humidity, a faint fog seeming to rise in 
the air, every surface bearing a faint slick of moisture against it. Above, a 
shaft continues almost endlessly, no end to the faint glimmering walls that 
rise up from this point.

A Turn in the Corridor~
   Far removed from the darker section to the east, this area is a glittering 
cacophony of azure and purple holographic panels and lights that shimmer along 
nearly every surface. Small, dark blue hexagonal panels make up the floors, 
walls, and ceilings, purple-tinged quartz shimmering between each of them in 
sequence, as if the area itself was pulsing with energy. The corridor seems to 
turn, continuing to the south.

purple light streaking between each of the panels every few seconds. Small 
bars of holographic light hover in the air just over the panels, no mechanism 
visible that might produce them. Despite the lights and the pulsing panels, 
the air here tastes stale in the extreme. The corridor continues to the west.

Between a Shaft and an Alcove~
   The air here is almost blue with light, the humidity continuing to rise 
until there is almost a fog of moisture in the air. Small blue hexagonal 
panels make up every surface, continuing what appears to be a constant curve 
around a center to the north. Bright panels of blue and purple holograms stand 
out in bars against the walls, lighting the area, the rolling clouds of 
moisture seeming to dazzle the lights into glimmering patterns against the 
walls. To the south, the small panels curve and flatten out, extending 
themselves into an alcove.
   To the north, a cave in has caused the entirety of that area to collapse into a massive heap of slag metal and debris.

A Light Filled Alcove~
   Rolling clouds of humidity permeate this area, causing the holograms that 
litter the walls to give the air an almost purple haze. In the midst of this 
area, there is a large rise in the small hexagonal tiles that make up the 
floor, rising into a table-like structure. Small ridges cover the top of the 
large panel, nearly a meter in width and the same in height. Over the panel 
floats an intricately detailed hologram of the lower portion of a #6Spire#0, 
slowly rotating.

   Like a long and slender inverted spire, the slender hologram stretches from

Thin at the bottom, and slowly rising in circumference through three different 
extensions, the observant might spot a small red circle at the very bottom 
point of the spire, and every half-dozen centimeters divisions within the 
hologram, counting some fifteen in total. Over the hologram, the spire seems 
to continue, but the hologram in that area is faded and indistinct.

Rising Stairs Toward a Door~
   Clouds of humidity roll slowly down a steep incline of small hexagonal 
panels, forming what appears to be a set of stairs leading toward a massive 
doorway. Small blue bars of holographic light glitter along the walls, giving 
every meter of this section a shimmering blue hue, as if one were standing 
under a shallow sea. A large doorway stands ahead, made up of a set of of six 
triangular portions that together make up the hexagonal frame of the doorway. 
A single holographic panel stands nearby, upraised from the doorway, a human 
hand outlined in purple light against it.

sloping tunnel down below. At the bottom of the tunnel is a hexagonal door 
with a single holographic panel upraised by the doorway, a human hand outlined 
in purple light upon it. Hexagonal ramps spiral down towards the north, east, 
and south, the faintest scent of rot emanating from those directions. The 
sound of rushing water is heard echoing in the background, the sounds bouncing 
off the walls and making it difficult to tell where they originate from.

Fork Next To An Incline~
   Here the hall curves out around a large center mass, two tunnels swerving 
out toward a moisture-filled hallway that shortly leads to a hollow arch and a 
room beyond. The hallway continues to darken as it leads northward, the lights 
on the wall seeming to reach a subdued state further down the way, beams from 
the moisture in the air barely visible. On the opposing side, the floor 
quickly drops down into a jarring slope, humidity coursing down in waves.

   Large pillars of quartz rise up from the blue hexagon panneled deck, small 
veins coming together in thick spires that reach to the ceiling of this alcove. 
Small blue holograms flicker and turn slowly around the pillars, an occasional 
line of symbols twisting across them. Within the pillars of quartz are what 
appears to be flowing water, pulsing slowly within the veins. A small control

   Thick spires of quartz branch over this area, flowing water coursing through 
each segment. Blue-tinged holograms circle the spires every few meters, the 
occasional string of symbols cutting across the continues blue bars. The 
hexagonal paneled deck seems to create an egg-shaped alcove around the pillars 
of quartz, each piercing both the top and bottom of the area. Thick clouds of 
humidity churn around the pillars, though it doesn't appear that they are 
originating from within them, the floor and walls only carrying a thin sheen of 
moisture. The area proper is raised above the tunnel that enters from the 
east, a small stairwell that formerly only provided means to reach the upper 
section now acting as a method of escaping the water and reaching a more dry 
climate. Relatively.

down the walls. To the east, the glint of quartz is visible, and to both north

uncharacteristic in the common structure of the ship, the area's shape making 
it difficult to see what is further down the way when standing at either side 
of the corner. Small openings in the hexagonal panels are visible along the 
wall, spaced rather close to each other and regular for a long way down, though 
the purpose behind them is not immediately apparent, aside from hazy clouds of 
humidity rising from each and dispersing into the air.

triangular panels reaching up to a central platform, where drops of water flow 
down along them and pool on the floor at the edges of the stairs. From the 
platform, a steady stream of mist is poured, the ceiling seeming to leak it 
here from holes arranged in circular formation, the light that shines brightly 
from behind the walls flickering and flaring against the flowing streams of 
haze that pour through the room, giving the whole area a sense of being 
underwater.

   This alcove presses into the blue-tinged hexagonal plated walls, forming a 
several meter wide space. Sleek holographics slowly flicker along the walls, 
complex looking symbols occasionally standing out for a moment before fading. 
Along the upper reaches of the alcove, a band of quartz a meter wide borders 
the room, purple and blue lights flickering within it, while the quartz itself 
seems to have been divided into small sets of etched cystals. In the midst of 
the floor the hexagonal plates rise up into a three meter high pedestal, 
several large ports giving access to what appears to be a glowing interior. 
Clouds of humidity swirl around the base of the machine, seeming to 
occasionally be pulled in through the ports.

outline of a human hand to the right of the display. A diagram of the two 
towers is visible at the center of the panel, and they seem to simply be blank, 
no readings coming from either tower.

Red-Lit Decline~
   The floor here slopes sharply down toward a large hexagonal door, large 
triangular panels clearly able to slide into the walls on either side. The 
normally blue holographics of this section have been replaced by small red 
bars, each of them moving slowly across the walls. The humidity here is almost 
non-existent, the air clear and dry. Small blue hexagonal panels make up the 
walls, but each is matte and flat, the lights behind them only slowly moving.

Decline Before a Massive Door~
   The deck here rises sharply before leveling off, a massive hexagonal-door in 
the midst of the rise. Over the door is the faint wisps of what might be a 
hologram, faint red points of light that seem to drift along the borders of the 
door. The air here is dry, yet alongside that is a faint organic scent that 
fills the corridor. The deck continues to the north, an occasional crack 
visible in the hexagonal paneling of the deck.

A Flickering Corridor~
   Dim red light flickers through this corridor, the bar-like holograms slowly 
moving along the hexagonal-paneled walls. In several places, a fleshy organic 
film has covered the walls, just a few centimeters thick. Light from beneath 
seems to press through it occasionally, but the organic layer stifles and 
darkens the corridor. Along the ceiling, several panels and hexagonal 
protrusions are visible, a low hum of machinery coming from them.

Junction Between Alcoves~
   This junction stands beneath a great hub of machinery that extends down from 
the ceiling, made up of the same hexagonal panels as the deck itself. Faint 
red light seems to emanate from bar-like holograms that rotate around the 
machine, filling the corridor. Small flashing symbols occasionally appear, 
flashes of crimson against the dark blue metal of the deck. Alcoves branch out 
to the north, west, and south, faint glints of something crystalline visible 
from the junction.

Turn in the Corridor~
   Almost no light at all fills this corridor, a thin organic film covering 
nearly every surface. Just a few centimeters thick, the top of the film is 
covered in bulbous nodes and ropey veins, spreading throughout the corridor. 
It grows thicker as the corridor turns to the north, small patches of chitin 
visible on occasion. To the south, the film thins out and becomes patchy, thin 
tendrils spreading in that direction.

   The film thickens here, a number of inches from the floor and spongey, 
overgrown nodes looking to be ready to burst, and veins snaking along through 
the room, crawling up the hexagonally-panelled walls quite a way, always 
trapped underneath the seemingly airtight growths all through the hallway, a 
sheer layer of thick chitin growing in wild patches, that is stiff and 
plate-like, the only surface that retains a sense of solidity in the area.

A Growth-encrusted Platform~
   Once a spacious spread of cobalt floors and decorative geometric inlaid 
designs, now most of this platform is caught in claustrophobic grip of an 
insidious growth spanning the length of it. What would have been chandeliers 
now serve as points where ropy lengths of black, grey, and green masses drape 
like tattered curtain pulls. Some bits of these growths along the floors have 
hardened, becoming brittle and probably crunchy underfoot, while others remain 
slick with somewhat fresh mucous-like fluid. Above all else, the tendrils are 
alive, twitches and shivers of movement from the numerous twisty ribbon-thin 
tendrils off-shooting from the growths visible wherever looked and wherever 
stepped, continuing on in every direction.

Chitin-Consumed Interior~
   Once an expansive room surrounding an elevator, some of the interlocking 
geometric panels can still be seen. Their blue surfaces have been dulled, 
smudged and covered with a layer of dust and organic goo. It clings to 
virtually everything, sweeping up in great whorls while some areas have been 
overlaid with portions that are almost like great chitinous boils, set into the 
innards of the ship. In some ways it is reminiscient of a macabre version of a 
theatrical establishment, with the loops and tiered set up high above. 
Meanwhile, when time is taken to admire the expansive of corrupted 
architecture, mucus-like tendrils drip down towards any observers.

Lobby Draped with Alien Whorls~
   In an elaborate trail, chitinous outgrowths sweep upwards towards the 
ceiling in spiraling designs, looking stable enough to put weight on. The 
black, grey, and green hardened sludge almost completely covers the blue 
hexagons that make up the interior of the base ship. Given the state of the 
gigantic room, the hardened masses almost drape from the ceiling, coating much 
of the walls in their tendrils and hardening to pooled masses like enormous, 
dark stalactites and stalagmites. Very little of the floor is still visible 
underfoot, instead coated in a surprisingly resilient, slick black growth which 
has been pocked with enormous, chitinous pustules.
   To the north, a cave in has caused the entirety of that area to collapse into a massive heap of slag metal and debris.

A Growth-buried Alcove~
   Though the bone-structure and some of the underlying glory of this foyer 
remains, the cobalt-colored floors have been overtaken by a thick and hardened 
growth. The mottled black, green, and grey of the clumps on the floor dull 
whatever shine might have remained and corrupt the inlaid floor, leaving little 
cracks as infiltrating tendrils threaten to split the once-seamless designs. 
Ropes of that same growth matter drape from the ceiling, from long-dead 
fixtures, some bits and tendrils appearing alive as they writhe slightly in 
mid-air. Ending in a curve here, this space settled near the elevator 
continues westward back to a slightly elevated landing.

layer~
This layer of growth is very thick and prevalent along the entire room, reaching out into
the hallway beyond, with not a bit of the floor left untouched, and only a small circle
left free on the ceiling. It looks to have crawled from within some pods, explosively
growing outward from one here and there about the area, and creeping down to the ground,
the surface spongey, but tightly stuck to the surfaces, huge organic bulbs residing in
clusters, some so large as to render walkways in the area unuseable.

Red-Lit Area Before A Massive Door~
   The deck rises here, up to a huge hexagonal door, a slowly pulsing arc of 
red light radiating around the portal, bright enough at its peak to light the 
area at least somewhat adequately, but quickly dissipating to the point of 
darkness before long, and plunging the silent hallway into black. Along the 
paneled floor crawls an organic film, fairly thin, and only an inch from the 
metal at its thickest points. Near the door, it disappears entirely, and 
leaves only tiny tendrils and the occasional small globule festering near the 
triangular steps that lead up to the next deck.

Circular, Stair-Filled Room~
   Two semicircular sets of triangular-paneled stairs hug the walls of the room 
here, ascending from the base of the area, where a huge hexagonally-shaped door 
stands, its own parts made up of a number of triangles in a composite portal 
that opens outward into the frame surrounding it. The walls pulse with a 
bright red holographic light near the bottom of the circular room, but on the 
ascent toward the hallway leading south, they phase into darkness, and near the 
crest of the stairwells, faint blue light shines out from between the 
wall-panels, quite weakly, but visible nonetheless. This space is free from 
gravity, lending little bits of refuse and riff-raff to float endlessly.

innocent. The entirety of the area has been suspended in a zero-gravity 
environment, causing any unsecured objects to float. Countless debris clutters 
the air, from metal junk to less savory objects - skeletal limbs - float in 
place. Curiously, there are two crane-like platforms in the direct center of 
the area, reachable by the walkway that extends from the entrance to a control

themselves.

Hallway Surrounding An Irridescent Pillar~
   The hallway stretches around a central, cylindrical pillar that rises in the 
center of the room, its surface composed of tiny hexagonal panels that mesh 
together so closely as to resemble a fish's scales, tiny motes of twinkling 
blue light dancing up between the edges of the hexagons and rising toward the 
ceiling of the area. The lights are so numerous, infact, that it gives the 
impression that there is a constant wave of blue rising in the room, the 
holographic shine that emits from the walls mirroring the central pillar, if 
only in hue. To the north, east, and south, the hallway continues, a healthy 
blue color following the walls in each direction.

   The colors in this area are quite subdued when compared with most of the

growing very muted and quiet here, as the area rises up on a bit of a slope 
from the west to a platform at it's center. Encasing the platform are 
transparent, paneled rails that separate the rest of the room, which is airy 
and large, from the junction, and they allow exit through a path in each of the 
cardinal directions. Chunks of metal and plastic hang in the air along with 
less savory bits, preserved human parts and chunks of flesh, forever buoyed by 
the lack of gravity.

of many triangular panels fused together lead up each side of the platform, and 
a glasslike railing surrounds it, small rays of blue light flaring across it in

   This room is a fairly compact deep-blue dome, a fork leading in three 
directions to a wide array of dead panels and video-displays. If they ever 
flickered with life, they are silent now. The lights appear to have also gone 
out, or properly 'exploded', their cracked husks hanging and empty. Suspended 
in zero-gravity, debris, glass, and bones hang in place, buoyed and forever 
hanging. A few smears of rust-colored material dot the floor, though the 
source has long-ago eroded.

A Small, Faintly-lit Alcove~
   Conspicuously, all of the video display screens in this room are dormant and 
nonworking, no text visible across the panels and no quiet hum coming from the 
processing unit behind them. Were they functioning, there is a rather large 
control panel near the center of the area, with many tiny switches and buttons 
below tiny labels that indicate their function in shorthand. Contrary to the 
rest of this part of the ship, this part is totally silent, despite the room's 
walls emitting the pale blue holographic light that indicates functioning. 
Bits of debris hang in the air, buoyed by zero-gravity. Some appear to be 
flecks of metal or glass while others are less savory -- chunks of bone and 
preserved, dehydrated flesh.

However, all the screens are black and dead. Triangular, paneled chairs float 
haphazardly here, with no gravity to hold them down. On the perimeter of the

otherwise silent room. Many types of debris hangs in the air, lifted by the 
lack of gravity. Some pieces are simple metal or plastic, while others look

   Smooth, cobalt-hued plates, roughly the size of a human's hand, are shaped 
into perfect hexagons that line the walls, floor and ceiling of the hallway. 
Some of the plates closest to the eastern end of the corridor are bulging and 
cracked. Faint purple light emits from behind the quartz-like mortar between 
each plate, providing just enough illumination to see unaided. A similar, dim 
glow comes from the west, while the eastern corridor leads to shadowy wreckage.

   Honeycombs of dark blue plating sheathe the corridor, with the gaps between

by the sound of dripping water. Hard, unrelieved walls amplify each drip, and 
any speech above a whisper is similarly echoed. The corridor curves downward 
in a sharp bend to the south, while the western passageway continues on a 
shallow, dimly lit decline. The junction is bare, lending an abandoned feel.

   Mist ebbs and flows here as air languidly circulates in the area. The 
temperature is quite chilly, save for an occasional lapse where faint warmth is 
blown in from the south. Condensation has formed on the sleek, deep-blue walls 
and ceiling, water occasionally rolling down the hexagonal patterns to the 
floor. Every now and then the blue tiles shimmer in a purple light which 
catches in the mist. A slight incline in the passageway leads west, while a 
steeper, curving decline leads south into a thick, purple-tinged fog.

A Foggy, Deep-Blue Passageway~
   The corridor here stretches upward to the north, and downward to the west in 
a slow, spiraling slope. Blue and purple light fills the area, refracting in 
the thick, shifting fog that permeates from below. The walls and floor, 
difficult to see from even an arms-length away, consist of hexagonal panels of 
a deep-blue material that is slippery to the touch due to the clinging 
dampness. It is especially slick the further west one goes as the corridor 
begins to become submerged in uncomfortably warm water. The temperature of 
this passageway shifts between cool and warm as the tepid air circulates.

A Flooded, Rounded Chamber~
   At the bottom of the sloping corridor, this area has been completely 
submerged under uncomfortably hot water. The water does little to stop the 
phosphorescent limning of the dark-blue hexagonal panels from filling the area 
with an eerie, hazy purple glow. A large #3pillar#0 stands at attention in the 
middle of the chamber, and has a narrow, jagged rupture splaying out of its 
metal cladding. The flooded passageway curves upward to the east.

A Deep-Blue Corridor~
   The passageway slowly inclines to the east and declines further to the west 
here and is lit by slowly pulsating, deep-blue and purple lights. The source 
seems to be coming from the walls of crystalline, hexagonal panels, and from 
the floor and ceiling made of the same. The sound of dripping water can be 
heard echoing in the corridor, louder to the east than to the west.

   Faint echoing can be heard in the distance of the rising corridor to the

light glows in this corridor, radiating from the hexagonal tiles of a cobalt 
colour that composes the ground, walls, and ceiling. The crystalline material 
of the blue tiles causes the echoes to seem louder, every movement amplified.

At a Four-Way Intersection~
   This intersection features a large number of rounded intersections. Where 
walls meet with ceiling and floor, corners have been left out, replaced by 
smooth, curved blue, hexagonal tiles that otherwise match the rest of the 
environment perfectly. While to the north and south the corridors can be seen 
turning off to the east, the corridors to the east and west look to stretch 
into infinity, no end in sight. A purple haze caused by light catching on the 
dusty, stale air of the room, makes navigating directions as difficult as it 
makes breathing.

A Gentle Curve in a Deep-Blue Corridor~
   Sound seems to echo especially well here as the walls do a sloping, gentle 
curve to the east and to the south. The room is in nearly pristine condition 
as well. The walls, ceiling, and floor all seem to be made from the same 
material, a cobalt-blue set of hexagonal panels that slowly pulse blue and 
purple light into the room. One of the ceiling panels, however, has a small 
crack in it which doesn't seem to effect its light-bearing performance.

   The rounded corridor continues to the north and to the south evenly, no 
changes in elevation notable at all, though to the north the passage seems to 
disappear somewhere to the east. The deep-blue color is starting to pulsate 
more rapidly with the lighter purple color here, the effect completely silent. 
The crystalline nature of the walls, along with the rounded, smooth shape, 
causes sounds to echo incredibly well, making noises sound much closer and 
louder than they likely are.

much further to the south as the path curves elsewhere, out of sight. The 
sound of water can be heard somewhere nearby, but the sound is faint and the 
source indeterminable, the corridors echoing even the faintest of sounds 
wildly. The walls, ceiling, and floor are made up of flawlessly carved 
cobalt-blue panels, hexagonal in shape, that emit a low level of purple light 
in a pulsing pattern.

   The corridor here bends to the north and to the west here, lined by smooth, 
rounded, hexagonal tiles. The tiles appear perfectly sculpted and show now 
signs of damage or marring, and are a deep, cobalt blue in color. They appear 
to be slightly transparent, as they occasionally pulsate with a purple colour 
beneath which escapes out through the tiles and the thin space between each. 
The light they give off isn't much, but it does allow for decent enough vision 
as the entire passage is bathed in a purple wash at all times.

The entire span of the corridor seems awash in purple and blue colors, the blue 
from the material of the hexagonal panels which form the corridor, and the 
purple from the light that the panels give off. The air here seems thick and 
stale, as if it hasn't been circulated in a long time.

deep blue hexagonal panels with low purple light being emitted somewhere

   This ladder emerges from the blue tiles of the northern wall. It has been

to be any damage done to the tiles at all where the thin metal bars jut out. 
Each rung of the built in ladder only extends two inches out from the wall, and 
with the thickness of the rungs, someone of large stature would have 
difficulties climbing up. The metal is cold and of an unidentifiable material.

A Rubble-Strewn Platform~
   Above the corridor below, this area is made of the same deep-blue tiles and 
glows the same dim purple color. Unlike the area below, however, this area 
looks like it hasn't seen use in quite some time, the entire platform covered 
in debris. Some of mess appears to be the same crystalline material that forms 
the ceiling and floor, while there is a large amount of gathered dust and 
various stones littering the rest of the area. The effect causes this area to 
be much less well lit, as the primary source of light only comes from the 
southern wall and the ceiling above.

A Rubble-Strewn Platform~
   This portion of the large platform features rounded corners where the walls 
meet, giving it a semi-circular appearance. The walls and ceiling are formed 
of hexagonal, deep-blue panels which fill the room with a hazy purple light 
which catches on the dust. The floors are also covered in these, though the 
various rocks, garbage, and a thick layer of dust obscure the floor completely 
in most areas.

A Rubble-Strewn Platform~
   This area of the platform reaches a loosely defined corner, the walls 
curving to give the room a more rounded shape. This area doesn't seem to have 
seen much use, and is difficult to navigate due to the rough, uneven features 
of the rubble that has been abandoned haphazardly on the floor. There is a 
small vent on the ceiling, circulating cold air into the room which unsettles 
dust and makes the air difficult to breathe.

A Rubble-Strewn Platform~
   This area of the platform features a number of damages to its structure. 
The value tiles on the floor are uneven and often chipped, but still too 
attached to be lifted off. The northern wall shows the most damage where a 
spider web of cracks, with an obvious focal point, has formed as if something 
large had, at one point, been rammed into it. As a result, a lot of the light 
potential in this rubble-strewn area is lost.

Before a Narrow Vent, On a Rubble-Strewn Platform~
   While this area is a dead-end as far as proceeding anywhere goes, the 
passageway is actually quite large. Various pebbles, stones, and larger rocks 
litter the area, though they don't seem to originate from anywhere nearby. The 
floor beneath the rocks and a thick layer of dirt, as well as the walls and the 
ceiling are made out of deep-blue hexagonal panels that emit a low level of 
purple light over the area, making it difficult to even identify the colors of 
the platform properly. To the north is a large #3vent#0, though only a small 
part of it is accessible at all, otherwise blocked off completely by debris and 
one enormous boulder.

small slits put into its expanse which makes peering into the darkness beyond 
neigh-impossible. Whatever is beyond, it is certain that there aren't more 
blue hexagons, at least not in a currently functioning form.

the east nor the west. There does seem to be an intersection to the west, 
which is the only easily discernable thing in sight, save the floors, walls, 
and ceiling of this rounded passageway. The slowly emitted purple light given 
off by cobalt, hexagonal tiles is definitely the source of the problem, giving 
the corridor and everything else an eerie, disorienting haze. The passageway 
here is echoes well, causing muffled, reflected copies of any noise made 
within.

   Though a wall can be seen off to the east, the corridor stretches on out of 
sight to the west, lost amidst pulsating purple lights and a thin veil of dust. 
This portion of the long corridor echoes particularly loudly, making any 
movement or noises rebound to be heard more than once with clarity. Hexagonal 
tiles, smaller than an average person's hand, line the walls floor and ceiling 
without stop and allow for a decent amount of light. The purple color of the 
light, however, makes discerning other colors a laborious task.

stale. Deep-blue hexagonal tiles create the corridor, while a soft purple glow 
that comes from beneath them fills the corridor with pulsing light. Though the 
area is mostly flat and easy to traverse, the path begins to descend to the 
north where the air grows thicker and even colder.

floor faintly ascends. The air here is moist and chilly, and the sound of 
dripping water echoes from somewhere nearby. The corridor is lined with 
deep-blue panels that emit a soft, purple glow, though the light struggles to 
shine through on the western wall where some kind of greenish #3mould#0 has 
been taking over.

the wall very well. It also shares the color of vomit, somewhat greenish 
faintly intermingled with other, lighter colors. Its source is also 
undeterminable, seeming to have just shown up rather than sprouting out of any

with rivulets of condensation that drip and slide down the blue hexagonal 
plates and trickle down the passageway. The purple light emanating from the

give the room a dim haze. Moisture has collected on the tiles, occasionally 
dripping and giving the corridor an ambient noise level. The liquid also makes 
the ground somewhat slippery and dangerous. Once something were to be set into 
motion, it would be difficult to stop as the ground seems to slip into a 
steeper grade in the distance, where things look even more damp.

there seems to be an intersection that branches off a new length of corridor to 
the north and south. The air here is stuffy with dust and a stale flavor, and

and glossy. A purple-hued glow is softly emitted by each one at different 
times, each panel diming and brightening in a random looking pattern. This 
makes shadows nonexistent at times, while at times shadows dance wildly. A 
small alcove appears to be built into the south eastern portion of the bend.

them shattered in like glass, and are extremely sharp to the touch. Those that

vent~
   This vent, stretching from floor to the ceiling and nearly covering the 
entire western wall in width, looks like it once held a purpose. Now, however, 
it lies dented and damaged in the wall. It looks more like a vent than a gate 
of sorts, however, as it is riddled with tiny pinpoint holes in an orderly 
manner, though what lay beyond it cannot be seen as a cloud of dust on the 
other side prevents light from passing very far within. On the sides of the 
vent are bent and crushed tracks that presumably once allowed the vent to be 
raised and lowered, but now hold the large sheet of metal firmly in place. 
Cold air escapes the vent, providing a source of fresh air.

A Bend in the Deep-Blue Corridor~
   The corridor here takes a gradual bend to the east and north, and is 
somewhat narrow here as compared to the intersection to the north. With only 
enough room for two or three people to stand side by side and a thick, stale 
air, this room has a cramped feeling. More foreboding, however, is the path to 
the east, which is dark and shadowy, the purple light that floods this area not 
reaching much further where the pulsating, deep-cobalt blue tiles no longer 
seem to be activated.

At the Bottom of a Spiraling Passage~
   Though the ground flattens out to the west, this corridor slowly spirals up 
and out of sight. The corridor is formed of dark blue hexagonal tiles of 
quartz like nature. This area is dark, however, unlike the area to the west 
which leaks a minimal amount of purple light into the corridor. When lit, this 
corridor creates long shadows as light catches in thick, dusty air that makes 
it difficult to breathe. There is also a metallic smell to the air, ruining 
any chance that the air here is entirely natural. A low hum can be heard 
coming from somewhere, the noise calmly echoing up the spiraling ramp.

Midway in a Spiraling Passage~
   In the midst of the spiraling ramp, this area receives no source of light, 
all the blue, hexagonal tiles deactivated in this area. Dust clings to the 
air, walls, and floor, like a thick blanket, and it is clear that air rarely 
moves in this area as it is stagnant and somewhat metallic smelling. From the 
west to the north the spiral moves at a downward slope, and the tiles offer a 
decent amount of traction which helps traversing the area, due to the steepness 
of the passage. Sound bounces about erratically in this curving area, making 
the source of any noise hard to determine.

At the Top of a Spiraling Passage~
   Though the ground begins even near the west, this passage begins to spiral 
southward, before continuing to the east in a steep, downward slope. The air 
here feels a little dusty, and is certainly rarely circulated. A dim amount of 
purple light flashes in the distance to the west in a rhythmic pattern, while 
the rest of the passage is filled with inky darkness, obscuring the dark blue 
color of the deactivated tiles that form the walls, ceiling, and floor.

A Spiraling Decline into Flooded Tunnels~
   A wide deep-blue ramp comprising of hexagonal panels spirals down, down, and 
down into the darkness, ending in murky waist-deep waters. To the east is a 
wide hexagonal entrance that leads into violet-lit halls. The stench of 
rotting flesh clings to the air here like a perfume, gradually growing worse as 
one descends. The glow in the walls is absent here, leaving this area in 
darkness.

the thick metal skeleton of the ship underneath. The collapsed ceiling makes 
passage difficult and narrow; there is only room for one man to squeeze abreast 
here. The hexagonal deep-blue walls have no glow to them, leaving this area in

Before a Collapsed Vent, In Murky Waters~
   This area stops at a dead-end, although it opens into a fairly wide 
passageway. The stagnant water here levels into a wider surface area, making 
the murky black waters ankle-deep. Large amounts of debris are scattered in no 
apparent pattern, rocks, pebbles, strips of cloth, and metal floating about. 
Like the rest of the ship, the interior is comprised of deep-blue hexagonal 
panels, though they give no light. Directly north is a large #3vent#0, but a 
large section has been apparently destroyed by some forceful trauma from debris 
or otherwise. A few #3skeletons#0 appear lodged inside the now narrow vent, 
all remains of skin and flesh gone - just dirtied bone.

vent~
   Nearly blocked off entirely, save small portions of its outer reaches, this 
vent, as far as it can be seen, is quite large, and could probably fit two 
people side by side behind it. It is nearly a solid gate of metal with only 
small slits put into its expanse which makes peering into the darkness beyond 
neigh-impossible. Whatever is beyond, it is certain that there aren't more 
blue hexagons, at least not in a currently functioning form. 
~

skeletons~
   These three skeletons have been shoved into the vent in various positions 
and quality. One of them looks to have been attempting to climb up, as its 
legs are propped on the vent as to give it leverage, and one of its arms - the 
other missing - is stretched outward, frozen in that position. The other two 
look to be sitting, facing out of the vent, their jaws open.

A Hexagonal Catwalk~
      The spiraling ramp suddenly narrows into a straight catwalk comprised of 
many glowing hexagonal platforms joined together by some type of welding. A 
thin beam of purple light appears to surround the lining of the panels, 
translucent but firm and rippling to the touch - a fence. Indeed, the 
platforms appear to float on their own, suspended by invisible cables or some 
other form of suspension. Down below is pitch-black darkness, the glow of the 
panels unable to pierce it. The only exception is an opaque deep-blue pillar 
to the direct south, with a hexagonal door reinforced into its structure, 
directly connected to the catwalk. The catwalk stretches from east to west.
    To the north, a cave in has caused the entirety of that area to collapse into a massive heap of slag metal and debris.

Dilapidated Storage-Bay~

them heavily damaged or destroyed entirely. One of the few rooms in the ship 
that has stood the test of time, the contents are mostly intact, though rust 
cakes the outside of the steel boxes, and the electrical locks are universally 
blackened and useless, the insides of the great storage containers lost to 
whatever knocked them out in the first place. The catwalk reaches out just a 
bit into the room, before breaking into a series of multi-levelled platforms 
that act as access to each palette of storage, stairwells composed of 
interlocking triangles providing means to search through the heavy debris and 
broken mechanisms of the wrecked sections. The lights along the catwalk are 
inactive here, simple hexagonal constructs that line the edge of the walkways 
here and there.

unwholesome organic matter. The glow of the walls ceases abruptly here - 
presumably by the water - and leaves the entire area in darkness.

   With paths leading off in multiple directions, this chamber forms a sort of 
intersection into multiple intersections. Water has completely flooded the 
area from a source that cannot be seen and is pleasantly warm, though the water 
is somewhat foul to taste with a light metallic flavor. Visibility is greatly 
impared as purple light refracts in the water, hexaganal tiles on the floor, 
walls, and domed ceiling pulsing with the hazy purple energy.

pleasantly warm water that exhibits a sharp, metallic taste. The source of the 
water is not obvious, the area completely clear of debris and the walls, floor, 
and ceiling in impeccable condition. Light slowly pulses through the room, 
refracting in the water, and any motion in the water makes sight incredibly 
strained. As the corridor bends to the north an incline can be seen, as well 
as the surface of the water, where as to the east the corridor continues

In a Damp, Angled Corridor~
   Holographic tiles, formed in hexagonal shapes, forge this corridor 
masterfully. There is only the tiniest of spaces in between each hexagon, and 
above where the ceiling rests, water slowly seeps from these spaces. Water 
noisily drips to the floor from here, and otherwise cascades down in a thin 
sheet on the walls, keeping them constantly wet. The water is warm to the 
touch and is the source of a fine mist in the air, which catches the purple 
light radiated by the slowly pulsing hexagon tiles. The entire corridor is set 
in a steep incline, rising to the north and descending to the south into a 
completely flooded passageway.

Before a Hexagonal Door~
   This section is a steep incline toward a heavy, hexagonal door set into the 
material of the walls, thin rivulets of water streaming down the sides of the 
incline. The door appears to be made from six separate triangles, meeting in 
the middle and able to retract into the walls themselves, integrated cleanly 
with the rest of the section. The holographics of this section appear to grow 
in strength, the small hexagonal panels underfoot pulsing every few seconds. 
To the south, the corridor continues downward, clouds of moisture hanging in 
the air.

   This chamber bears a sudden sharp incline, heading drastically down from the

refracted purple light is muted and murky amongst the faintly warm water that 
floods the entire passage, and as one reaches the depths of the former 
stairwell, small pieces of iron debris float about, the light refracting 
against the faces of tiny burnished steel objects, though they are all in such 
states of disrepair that nothing of worth might be salvaged from the wreck.

   A dark violet pulse perpetuates this area, the entirety of the deep tunnel 
narrowing to center around a hexagonal doorway that seems to have formerly been 
composed of triangular panels that make up the whole. Now, however, many of 
the door's components have been dislodged or broken from the original frame, 
and lay strewn at the foot of the incline, the floor leveling off and 
straightening off to a flat corridor beyond the hexagonal entryway. The 
outline of a hand that is just to the side of the doorway holds no color, 
dormant and inactive, and just below it in spartan blue lettering is the title

movement is quickly met with a cloud of murky, sickly-looking water, that 
obscures vision immediately and does not settle for some time after all is 
still in the area.

Platform Above the Flooded Deck~
   Extending far to the north, this area widens into a large, metal-ribbed 
hallway. A raised section of platform holds vigil over the rest of the area, 
positioned directly in the center of the intersection, and accessible via a 
ladder that reaches down into the water for more than a few feet. From this 
platform reach three blue-steel catwalks, a tight mesh of girders creating 
footing by which the storage bays at the east and west edges of the room might 
be accessed, as well as the next access hall, just to the south. In intervals 
along each of these catwalks are polyhedral lights composed of many hexagons, 
and these offer a pale violet glow for any crossing the walkways.

Precarious, Slippery Catwalk~
   The catwalks stretch out and raise further above the water here, the entire 
deck bearing a steady climb as it moves from north to south. A pale violet 
glow follows each of the walkways, though it reaches only so far, and the water 
far underfoot lies plunged in shadow, the sound of droplets plummeting from the 
damp walks all the way down to the surface the only hint that a watery grave 
awaits any who slip, given that there are no rails or means of protection from 
the dark void that lies beyond the edge of each catwalk. Entire sections are 
missing from the traverse, with the floor section torn away, and only the 
skeletal steel frame lies between, making it ever more tricky to make it across 
the slippery passage.

Broken Heights~
   Total darkness shrouds the thin, broken walkways of the storage facilities' 
heights, rivulets of water cascading down bent, broken girders that hang from 
an uneven, heavily-damaged ceiling. The floor underfoot is damp and rusted, 
and weight placed upon these catwalks yearns metallic creaks and groans, the 
thinner sections bending outward and threatening to drop any standing on them a 
fear-inspiring distance into pitch-black darkness. Dried blood cakes the sides 
of the walkways, and bloody scratch-marks line the edge of one, just off where 
a stray foot might lead to a sudden and brutal doom.

the top row of palettes. Containers have crashed down on every side, the walls 
and few pieces of machinery left up gruesomely gouged and ripped open by the 
falling tons of steel. The catwalk reaches only barely inward, before abruptly 
ending with a splintered section of broken blue iron. If one was to scale down 
the side of the broken walkway, an irregular bed of sharp scrap coats the room, 
and the floor is all but invisible beneath the dusty, damp wreckage.

Creaking, Dark Storage Bay~
   A dizzying array of containers fills this large room, the greater part of 
them heavily damaged or destroyed entirely. One of the few rooms in the ship 
that has stood the test of time, the contents are mostly intact, though rust 
cakes the outside of the steel boxes, and the electrical locks are universally 
blackened and useless, the insides of the great storage containers lost to 
whatever knocked them out in the first place. The catwalk reaches out just a 
bit into the room, before breaking into a series of multi-levelled platforms 
that act as access to each palette of storage, stairwells composed of 
interlocking triangles providing means to search through the heavy debris and 
broken mechanisms of the wrecked sections. Every platform and walkway here is 
showing signs of deterioration, and groans follow any weight, the lights that 
line the walks on the lower bays conspicuously absent here. Against one of the 
containers is a message drawn in blood, reading " #9WE CANNOT GET OUT#0 " - 
This line repeats itself many, many times, dragging all the way down the face 
of the container and trailing off in a smear.

Walls of Wreckage~
   There is no storage bay here. The entirety of the walls have collapsed 
inward, creating a passage that exists only as two landslides of razor-sharp 
steel, the skeleton behind the normally quartz-coated panels visible, and water 
leaking out from the ceiling in many places, creating a constant drip-drip 
beyond the range of sight. The walkway reaches all the way inward, and in some 
places is still traversable, making it possible to access parts of the 
wreckage, but the lights common to the lower sections of the storage facilities 
are absent here, a musty, damp feeling pervading the ravaged hall.

Control Bay~

them heavily damaged or destroyed entirely. One of the few rooms in the ship 
that has stood the test of time, the contents are mostly intact, though rust 
cakes the outside of the steel boxes, and the electrical locks are universally 
blackened and useless, the insides of the great storage containers lost to

broken mechanisms of the wrecked sections. A wounded control panel lies front 
and center as one comes in, the display blackened and screen cracked in many 
places, a single huge spot of blunt-force trauma visible at one edge. 
Curiously, surrounding this one spot is a ring of dried, dark-red blood.

Cramped Underwater Junction~
   The walls seem to close in as the tunnel becomes more claustrophobic and 
tight, very little room given on either side, and the junction in three 
directions seems more like a sewer pipe than a passage meant for human travel. 
The water is quite murky as well, and sight is mostly obscured for more than a 
couple of feet, darkness pervading the area here, as the purple light hangs low 
and barely visible.

Suspended Control Platform~
   This platform hangs just above the water's surface, miraculously dry and 
free of damage, a thin but extremely sturdy layer of blue-quartz panels fixed 
into the wall just beneath a large, flat electrical panel. An advanced and 
mind-boggling array of switches, pulsing lights, and dormant holographic 
display screens. The entire room stands mostly undamaged, and the purple light 
from the ceiling glimmers aganist the surface of the water, giving it an 
uncanny violet color from this angle.

Sludge-Coated Passage~
   Dusty, murky and narrow, the sludge that has gathered on the bottom of this 
blue-panelled passage dislodges with the slightest movement and rises up to 
coat the eyes and choke the lungs. A layer of clear muck clings to the walls 
and holds back the light, making this passage dark and slimy, any grip against 
the wall for stability lost to the slime.

Darkened Passage~
   The depths of the tunnel continue in pitch darkness, the pale light offered 
elsewhere completely absent in the dirt-coated grip of the continuing passage. 
Vision beyond a few feet is impossible in the muck, and occasional collapses 
cause an irregular path between hulking zones of sharp-looking scrap metal and 
broken quartz crystal.

Rising Hall~
   A rise in the footing drags the passage up from the water to the west, 
dampness hanging on every surface, and droplets of water running down the 
quartz panels all over, pooling on the floor and running off into the 
flood-zone. The hallway continues then with some, tiny pieces of rubble 
underfoot, turning sharply to lead off northward into more dry area. Purple 
light glimmers over the corridor, pulsating rhythmically like a very, very slow 
heartbeat.

Sparking Wreckage~
   The ceiling has collapsed entirely here, raining down crushed metal onto the 
walking area, and sparking circuits spray down from all sides of the damaged 
area, dancing menacingly close to the pools of water that have run off from the 
sections that produce floodwater. The light of the circuits dances across the 
pools constantly, reflecting against the surface in a corona against the faded 
purple light that radiates from just beyond the wreckage.

Turn in the Hallway~
   The corridor bears a turn from east to south, pieces of rubble and scrap 
iron hanging in the way of safe passage, but on the whole, the area is fairly 
easy to navigate, and rather contrasts against the harsh terrain surrounding 
it. Dampness hangs in the air, and it is possible to rub away a thin layer of 
humidity condensed on the walls, but the floor is water-free and only slightly 
dusty.

Floodwater Tunnel~
   Two paths break off in half-circles around a central vent here, water 
pouring down and leaking into the hull beneath the floor, running off eastward 
and pouring out from holes on the floor in that direction. An artificial 
waterfall of sorts, the source seems endless, and a constant mist of 
metallic-tasting water coats the platforms around the periphery of the pool, 
clinging to anything passing along, and the rails alongside the roiling depths.

Water-Filled Chasm~
   A jagged hole makes up the greater part of this corridor, carved into the 
floor by virtue of the wrecked walls, which sag outward from their now-broken 
supports, ceiling fixings pouring out from behind the otherwise solid wall of 
blue hexagonal panels. Water pours out from the crack and steadily fills a 
growing pool to the east, the hallway dipping down below the surface and 
preventing passage in that direction, except by swimming.

vent allowing slow escape for the liquid trapped on the deck. A junction 
breaks off in three directions, endless panels of blue quartz and a steady swim 
bringing access to the hallways that lay beyond, low groans and clanks of metal 
resounding far beneath the surface of the lukewarm water.

Tunnel In The Deep~
   A steady turn, deep beneath one of the many flooded sections of the deck, 
bears ever deeper and lower here, dipping down in a long tunnel from north to 
west. Pulsating violet light casts its glow over the small bubbles and tiny 
floating debris that drifts lazily through the passage, the entirety of the 
panelling intact and functioning, a low humming noise sounding from the depths 
of the area, and growing ever louder to the west.

   A junction bears in three directions here, a collapsed section of wall 
making passage westward very difficult. The great majority of the panels offer

westward into the tunnel that way, darkness falls and hangs ominously beyond 
the slowly-pulsing glow and tiny bubbles floating from floor to ceiling.

   A dead end stands at the end of the tunnel, walls and ceiling collapsed 
inward onto the room, masking whatever use it might have held in the past. A 
sea of blue-quartz panels coat the floor like fish scales, their glint lost in 
the darkness that hangs over the dust and dirt-caked base of this part of the 
flood-zone. Here the water is at its coldest. Frigid, murky, and stagnant.

   A low clanking sounds from outside the walls, repetitive and dull behind the 
faintly-glowing walls of quartz. Bubbles fill the passageway from vents in the 
floor, and strange markings line the south side of the wall, following the bend 
along as it heads toward more of the darkness. One side of the room has a 
number of dents in the wall in the approximate dimensions of a human head, a 
rust-colored smear giving further credence to such an assumption.

platforms joined together by some type of welding, the glowing emanating from 
the platforms is erratic and flickering, and there appears to be absolutely no

into the deep darkness below. The platforms appear to float on their own, 
suspended by invisible cables or some other form of suspension. Down below is 
pitch-black darkness, the glow of the panels unable to pierce it. The catwalk 
stretches from east to west and south.

stairwells composed of interlocking triangles providing means to search through

A Precarious, Tilted Catwalk~
   Almost as if by magic, a catwalk is suspended above the ground here, 
attached to a ramp to the west and to the east. The catwalk itself is barely 
visible, formed of translucent hexagonal tiles which seem to react to pressure, 
emitting a faint purple light when weight is added to them. The catwalk 
appears to be suspended by wires of some sort, too thin to be seen by the naked 
eye, but perceivable to the touch. If it weren't for a few collections of 
dust, and a blood splatter that appears to be floating in the air, it would 
almost be completely imperceptible. The entire area is naturally dark, 
however, the tiles on the walls, ceiling, and the flooded floor below 
apparently inert.

In a Cramped Storage Compartment~
   Cramped and stuffy, there is little room in this compartment for more than 
two people. A low ceiling would make standing a challenge, and stagnant, musky 
air makes breathing a challenge, the smell of mildew and rot evident in every 
breath. There is little room to navigate, as the area is laden with debris. A 
lot of it has managed to break down in a wet, sticky mess due to contact with a 
leaking ceiling, while other things have soaked the water up to create heavy, 
mildew-laded obstacles. A hexagonal door marks the only exit from this area, 
no visible ground available past it. Small blood spatterings, however, seem to

Light-Filled Cylindrical Hall~
   The water has not reached this section of the deck, the stairwells leading 
up to the greater part of the hall out from the murky liquid to lead up in 
opposing scaffolding that hugs the outer edge of circular walls. A huge 
cylinder composes the shape of the passage, looming far upward with 
incandescent purple light radiating in waves from the deep-blue panels that 
coat the wall. At the peak of the rising stairwell, a smaller circular 
platform connects the two sides, and from them a large vent on the south side 
of the area. Two functioning electrical panels protect most of the entry, but 
a miniature slot remains open, allowing travel by something very small.

Up a Flooded Tunnel~
   Darkness pervades the depths here, motes of dust and tiny balls of mangled 
scrap floating amongst the torn-down walls and general wreckage. The tunnel 
stretches onward as far as the eye can see, the glow of the walls completely 
shut off and dormant. Muck on the floor of the area floats up when disturbed, 
and settles into a dirty cloud of miasma that coats the body and clings to the 
skin.
