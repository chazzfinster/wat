Inside an Industrial-Sized Freezer~
   This freezer is as large as about half the size of a small 
bedroom, providing enough space for quite a lot of food to be 
stored. A thin layer of ice covers the walls and floors though a 
rubber-like rug is spread out upon the ground to prevent 
slipping. A bright light has been attached to the ceiling to 
light the whole room and is perpetually on as long as the freezer 
itself is working.
