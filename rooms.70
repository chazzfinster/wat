Dull Interior of a Train Carriage~
   Perhaps originally designed for transporting livestock or some 
other bulk commodity, this train carriage is as plain as it is 
roomy. The frame has been constructed from a dull ironalloy and 
is decidedly boxy in construction, right angles joining the 
ceiling, walls and floor. Long slit windows stretch across both 
sides of the carriage, several thin rectangles cut out from the 
frame and filled in with a scratched, glass-like substances, 
beyond which the drab and featureless plains of the moon are 
barely visible. Two rows of hard, burgundy red soliplas seats 
run down either side of the carriage, all of them set to face the 
opposite direction to which the train is traveling. The aisle 
between the rows is uncomfortably large, further than the reach 
of even the tallest of people. At one end of the carriage the 
seats have been replaced by a wire ironalloy cage on either side, 
a series of heavy locks running down the side, and a heavy door, 
unpainted like the rest of the train, is set in either far wall.

Inbetween Train Carriages~
   A vicious wind whips past as the boxy, dull-metal utility 
train hurtles down the line. This narrow platform joins two of 
the rectangular carriages, and you are protected from falling 
beneath the whells only by a thin metal chain and a short, 
rusting platform. There is barely enough room for two people to 
fit in to this tiny space between the two heavy doors. The 
thundering sound of the wheels of the tracks, combined with the 
ghoulish howl of the wind, makes any attempt to speak here 
extremely difficult. The drab, featureless terrain of the moon 
passes by in the blur.

Ruined Half-Shell of the Carriage on the Plains~
   Dashed across the dust-grey plains of the wilderness of the 
moon, the top of the train carriage has been ripped clean off, 
deposited a good hundred metres away from where the rest on its 
side of the metal compartment has come to rest against the lip of 
a small, shallow crater. The other five carriages of the train 
have suffered similar fates, scattered like a child's toys and 
having sprinkled the hard, burgundy soliplas seats. The railroad 
itself has been ripped asunder, with large blackened holes 
running along its surface for what must have been at least the 
length of the train. Further from this wreckage, there is 
nothing to the horizon but a continuation of the dusty plains and 
the track leading north and south.

On the Tracks near the Wreckage~
   A heavy set of metal and ceramic railway tracks runs straight 
north to south here, its imperial march across the moonscape 
plains ruined only by the horrific wreckage of the overturned 
train carriages to the south. A small embankment of dirt has 
been built up to bear the tracks a foot or so above the rest of 
the pitted moonscape terrain that runs as far as the eye can see 
to the east and west, while the tracks themselves creep endlessly 
north and south.

Near the Wreckage on Endless Moonscape Plains~
   This area of walk seems lifeless and barren. Everywhere one 
might step is uneven and awkward for traveling across, with small 
meteorite holes covering the surface. The holes range from 
barely noticeable indents to caping holes large enough to hide a 
small man or animal. Everywhere one looks is grey bleakness and 
inhospitable landscape. To the west, the wreckage of a dull 
metal, six-car utility train lies.
