Round, Plexiglass-Bound Lift~
   This lift is little more than a moving platform, cylindrically shaped in a 
skeleton of metal. It is surrounded in the metal cage, with gears and 
mechanisms at the top to slide the plexiglass panels up individual of each 
other. There are four in all, opening in all three-hundred sixty degrees and 
allowing passage onto the landing. The northern part opens directly into a 
corridor, a laboratory visible beyond. All of the others show beyond the 
plexiglass a grey and white floored landing.

Corridor Between a Lift and Labratory Checkpoint~
   Muted grey polymesh carpet stretches over the floor here, retaining little 
of the original plush nature. Grime and rubble from the crumbling polycrete 
ceiling has worked into the fibers, giving it a 'crunchy' texture. The 
polycrete walls and ceiling were painted a stark white though now they show 
faint discoloration and mold in the corners. Thick ropy root systems taking 
advantage of the cracks in the ceiling seems to be the main cause of the 
destruction here, as they hang like heavy clumps of serpents towards the 
ground. A few posters line the walls, along with a sign depicting an #2arrow 
and beaker#0, pointed northward. Just around the entryway to the laboratories 
beyond, bioluminescent moss has started to creep, tendrils of glowing 
blue-green life stretching closer, like crooked fingers.

Circular Landing Sweeping to the Southeast~
   The floor has been cloaked largely in once-plush muted grey carpet although 
now it appears more grimy than muted, with several dark-hued grease-like stains 
marring the polymesh. The walls are painted polycrete and appear almost new 
but for the snaking intrusion of black mold and #6luminescent moss.#0 Root 
systems have infiltrated through the ceiling and hang down like thick ropes 
towards the floor, the occasional clump actually spanning the entire distance. 
Some decoration once covered the walls in the form of propaganda posters. Most 
have been torn down or made illegible by mold but one in particular shows a 
#2six-fingered claw-like hand#0 run through by a knife.

Southern Part of a Circular Landing~
   The rotted smell of old mold hangs in the air, which also seems 
overwhelmingly stale in taste as though the purification system has long-since 
failed in this structure. Mold peppers the painted white polycrete ceiling and 
walls, even apparent in streaks across the once-plush muted grey carpet. 
Chunks of polycrete have fallen from the ceiling, having been pushed aside by 
thick root systems infiltrating from above. Shattering further on impact with 
the floor, they create a rubble which crunches should it be passed over. A 
trail of #1brown-red droplets#0 follow straight path from east to west.

Eastern Part of a Circular Landing~
   The carpet covering this landing just before a plexi-glass elevator shaft is 
muted grey, once plush and now simply caked with dust. The ceiling and walls 
are painted white polycrete, the walls themselves intact but the ceiling badly 
segmented as clumps of ropy roots have taken advantage of natural cracks in the 
structure. They hang like lazy serpents, dangling down to the floor. 
#1Rust-brown drops#0 have long since dried into the carpet and lead a few steps 
towards the lift before becoming a massive irregular stain. Just to the side 
of the stain is a hand print on the wall and another on the floor, both that 
same #1red-brown#0. From that point onward until just before the lift, the 
droplets become a drag mark, disappearing into the shaft.

Southeastern On a Circular Landing~
   Curved, leading both west down a corridor and northward, this section of the 
landing bears muted grey carpet, once plush but now damaged and dull. Rubble, 
chunks of fallen polycrete from the ceiling, crunch into the carpet and patches 
of dark mold form blotted patterns on once-white painted polycrete walls. The 
ceiling indeed seems to be coming undone as root systems have taken advantage 
of cracks and widened them, snaking downward to the carpet like lazy serpents. 
A trail of #1brown-red droplets#0 follow the curve of this space, growing 
larger in diameter going northward.

Southwest On a Circular Landing~
   Thick #6luminescent mold#0 drapes the painted polycrete walls and glows 
faintly in the corners were wall and floor meet, casting an eerie glow over the 
entire spacious landing. The floor itself is covered with once-plush muted 
grey carpet. Time and some long-ago scuffle has left evidence on the carpet, 
with several #1dark brown-red dribbles#0 leading from west to east in trail. 
Root systems have broken past the barrier of the polycrete ceiling and hang 
limply in clumps, with more clumps piled beneath from where over time the roots 
have withered and died.

Specimen Processing Center~
   Virtually ripped apart, the machinery and holding cages or tanks are strewn 
all over this area. A number of them have been grown over with 
#6phosphorescent moss#0, which clings to everything and creates a soft mat 
across regions of the floor. It also sticks into the crevices and cracks in 
the walls, and around the circular vents overhead. These have been invaded by 
roots, which also partition regions of the ceiling and crawl across it from 
above. To the west is a very large, secured airtight door.

Enormous, Chilly Freezer~
   While most of the facility seems to have fallen into disrepair and become 
overgrown, this room is more or less intact. All along the walls line a number 
of alcoves, with mist dripping off of them. Each is lit behind blue glass, 
with various labels scrawled on their fronts, written in Latin and, to those 
familiar with such things, the manner of marking a genus and species. The 
polycrete floor is open, and there is a wheeled ladder which can be swiveled 
around along its track up near the top of the room. A few cylinders on the 
floor, with liftable, sliding interiors are present. In the background of the 
room, the low hum of machinery can be heard.

Spacious but Dusty Laboratory Entry~
   The polycrete of this low-ceiling outstretched corridor of a laboratory is 
stained and broken in a few places, with an elaborate root system just 
beginning to peek out from circular vents inset into the ceiling. No light 
comes from the long halogen bulbs bared to observation. The floor is littered 
with broken glass and nearly every surface has started to grow thick webs of 
phosphorescent moss, seeming to come largely from a plant stand although the 
southern wall. To the east and west, the laboratory continues onward although, 
with this space marked off the occasional addition of torn polyprop curtains 
that hang in useless disrepair, guarding no one from entry. To the north is a 
bar-marked specimen cell.

Cluttered, Derelict Laboratory~
   Judging by the bullet holes of varying sizes peppering the walls, this room 
may have been used as a battlefield rather than the purpose it was previously 
intended for. While some tables are neatly aligned in rows, others have been 
overturned as makeshift barricades. Drawers have been pulled clean of desks 
and shelves have been hastily looted, leaving the floor scattered with broken 
equipment and papers which have decayed beyond the point of use or even simple 
recognition. The north wall yields to a set of metal bars, beyond which is a 
cramped cell.

Specimen Holding Cell~
   The once sterile white tiles of this cramped space have been permanantly 
stained a dirty brown hue from the neglect that this cell has suffered. Darker 
shapes and spots discolour the filthy tiles in places, where some fluid has 
been spattered against the wall long ago. The cell is largely unremarkable 
save for a set of claw gashes that have cut through the concrete and grouting 
of the tiled walls altogether, leaving behind a fine mist of concrete dust on 
the ground below. A sturdy cell door is set into the southern wall.

Laboratory Wing Stretching to the North and West~
   Two massive benches span the length of this room, parallel to one another, 
with a large work desk situated prominently before both. Laboritory equipment 
lines the benches, alongside glass containers with metal stands and tubing 
running between each, though hardly any remain intact judging by the amount of 
broken glass littering the floor. Some vials and beakers look to have 
contained fluid long ago, judging by the dark stains on the inside of the 
container. Most of the drawers and cabinets have been ransacked, save for the 
desk at the head of the room, where the remains smashed computer reside.

A Laboratory Reclaimed by Hanging Vines~
   In what was once a vastly sterile laboratory, reclamation has already 
progressed enough to take back the ceilings with thick ropy root-systems 
breaking through the polycrete. The longer tendrils hang like forked 
decoration all the way to the floor where they just brush the once-unmarred 
dingy white tile. A variety of long forgotten and extremely technical looking 
machines line the northern and southern corridor with a few more traditionally 
obvious ones dotted here and there: two abandoned cloning tanks, a rack of test 
tubes, several incubators, and one very large water bath caked with mold. The 
ever-present moss has found its way through the cracks of the tiles, creating 
dully-glowing grid patterns when viewed in passing and the air is stale.

Specimen Holding Cell~
   The floor of this cell gives away after a small platform to a 
liquid-retaining basin, the depth of which is hard to tell by sight as the 
fluid that previously filled it has turned to a viscous sludge. 
#6Phosphorescent moss#0 offers a dull glow which barely illuminates the small 
cell, the light reflecting from the surface of the oil-like sludge. The stench 
radiating from the room is repulsive, most likely due to the slimy remains of 
the creatures which bulge out from the surface of the fluid. Protruding from 
the northern wall is the metal lower lip of a large drainpipe which feeds the 
basin within the cell. The cell door to the south has been buckled outward 
from what one would presume to be a large amount of force, the hinges and 
framework having held, but only just.

A Large Office, Fallen into Disrepair~
   Dust has settled over every surface like a fine film, coating the faux-wood 
polyprop desks, the sleek once shiny metallic chairs, the ratty remains of a 
plum-hued polymesh carpet. Though faintly glowing moss grows where papers were 
once stacked neatly and trails along the seams where walls and floor meet, this 
room is otherwise untouched by life. A few yellowed picture-frames remain on 
the walls, the faces of long-dead loved ones faded almost to oblivion. Stains 
and water damage have changed the ivory shade of paint that covered the 
ceilings and walls to dingy grey and mold runs rampant in the worst spots, 
black and sickly looking.

A Large, Open Specimen Pen~
   Long ago, the smell of animals has faded from this place but what remains is 
worse. The broken bones of long-dead beasts litter the ground and grow thicker 
in the corners, with a few dulled metallic gun casings scattered among them. A 
drain rests in the absolute center of this dreary white-tiled room and the 
floor is slightly tilted inward, allowing for a sharp blast of water to send 
most of the refuse towards the grate. A cell door remains southward, breaking 
up the monotony of the plain north, east, and west walls. Though the cell door 
remains intact, the lock has been blown out by some sort of rapid-fire gunfire. 
   The room is alight with a strange glow coming not from the long-dead halogen 
lamps inset into the ceiling but from a thick #6phosphorescent moss#0 that 
drapes and crawls over each wall at least in portion.

Expansive and Abandoned Laboratory~
   Stained polycrete looms overhead, marked with unlit halogens. Most of this 
space is taken up metallic tables still bearing harnesses for larger animal 
study. Surgical-like tools were perhaps once laid out neatly but now litter 
the ground, most of them fallen to disrepair and warped over time. A fine dust 
settles over everything, probably coming from the crumbling plaster that still 
clings to the ceiling in patches. This space is curved, leading westward and 
southward to more laboratory space. To the north is a bar-marked cell door, 
beyond which several hanging cages can be seen.

A Cage-Filled Aviary~
   Upon entering, it becomes obvious that this room was crafted to house flying 
specimens. The walls are lined with hanging cages, most of are open and 
completely unused. A few remained closed and should they be inspected closely, 
tiny delicate bones litter the bottoms. Whatever smell outside of the musty 
scent of disuse has long ago faded from this space. The white-tiled floors, 
showing extensive dust and dirt build-up, dip inward slightly so that a sharp 
blast of water would send refuse rushing towards the grate of a drain resting 
in the absolute center of the floor surface.

polycrete, as is the floor. However a runner of dingy moldy carpet runs the 
curved length of this space, shaped to follow the line of the room perfectly. 
A few abandoned cages rest against the wall, beside complicated scanning 
machines bearing cracked screens and dangling ineffectual wires.

Eastern Laboratory Wing~
   At the end of this great stretch of laboratories, everything constructed of 
glass-like polyprop has been destroyed. Shards rest everywhere, positively 
littering the floor. The metal desks have been overturned, used as some sort 
of cover for what violence took place here long ago. A few rough gouges and 
bullet holes puncture the polycrete ceilings and floors and everything is 
lightly covered with a fine brushing of dust. Drawn in scrawling black, 
probably some kind of ink, are the words, #1'Get a gun and run for the door.

Abandoned Personnel Medical Center~
   This high-end medical facility is stocked with the best there is to offer. 
Several padded cots rest in semi-circle around the room, with sleek rolling 
tables positioned between them. Movable scanning devices can be shifted into 
position over the entire length of the cot, from head to toe of a patient 
resting there. Each device bears a complicated readout and probably serves 
multitude functions. Several shelves line the walls and the rotting remains of 
gauze and bandages settle between bottles of antiseptic and tubs of medicinal 
creams. However, the days of prime usage are passed and everything is dirtied 
by age. What was the stark white of polycrete has yellowed and become dirty 
over the time since this place was abandoned.

untouched by time. The walls themselves are painted a dull pewter, the shade 
of which mimics that of the silver sheen of the screens themselves. Several 
chairs rest around the room, many of them outfitted with screens that crane on 
movable metallic arms to rest before the occupant. The arm-rests are adorned 
with keypads allowing for a variety of functions although most of the 
characters have faded in time. Thick dusty carpet covers the floor and seems 
alive with the growth of #6bioluminescent moss#0 that snakes across it, 
shooting bright slashes of eerie blue-green glow through drab grey.

Passing through Personnel Commons~
   The arrangement of this common room resembles a living room on a grander 
scale, with several more stations of clustered chairs and end tables. Thick 
ropy roots have worked their way through the polycrete lining the ceiling, to 
hang in dangling tendrils down towards the floor. The floor itself is tile, 
crafted in a wavelike pattern of blue and white, rippling through the area. A 
thick door rests northward and double doors block the west but the room 
continues unhindered eastward and southward. 
   #6Bioluminescent moss#0 covers the eastern wall and has managed to creep in 
through the cracks of the door. It gleams a bright bluish color, clinging over 
the wall and up close to some of the vents.

Cracks in the wall show more, chunks of the polycrete having been turned to 
dust in the face of their intrusion. This entire room, where it's not 
disrupted with old stains or tree roots, has been painted a light, warm grey. 
The flooring is tiled in wavelike patterns of blue and white, rippling through

Personnel Processing~
   Once perhaps clean and tidy, complete with a series of basalt desks, this 
room has since fallen into disrepair. The light grey walls are ridden with 
cracks, tree roots growing down and into them from the circular vents overhead. 
Security checkpoints and x-ray scanners at each door have either been toppled 
over, or overgrown with #6phosphorescent moss#0. The doors themselves have a 
keypad present on the side, heavy with dust and other things that have 
ingrained themselves inside. Two elevator doors are now heavily tarnished 
metal, standing behind their checkpoint to the east.

Small Elevator Lift~
   Cramped but far from claustrophobic, this space is a perfect square room. A 
tattered and aged poster hangs on one of the manufactured 'mica-flecked' 
polyprop walls, proudly bearing anti-mutant sentiment in the succinct 
#1'Mutants: Rights? The Right to Die, Maybe.'#0 The other walls are plain, 
unadorned and molded to add dimension to what is largely a uniform coffin of a 
structure. To the side of the door is a row of small clear buttons that were 
once probably clearly lit though now are dim circles of polyprop. However, the 
straightforward arrangement of them gives clues to which direction each one 
leads.

Alcove-Lined Personnel Dormitory~
   This room is done in warm greys, with the short and now dusty carpet being 
more of a neutral and dark tone of it. Away from the door is a tier of steps, 
while away from it expands a flat area with plenty of space to stretch. The 
tiers themselves, covered in the same short carpet, lead gradually up to a 
series of alcoves with thin mats and surprisingly well-kept blankets resting 
inside of them. Even pillows are present. It is very quiet here, and sound 
seems to be muffled. Over the door leading back to the mess hall is a long, 
flat monitor screen set into the wall. 
   Crawling over the wall and into the creases of the ceiling is 
#6bioluminescent moss#0. Some of the sleeping cubicles have been dominated by 
it, showing like stars in the darkness. It's also eaten a few blankets.

the dirt originates from a gigantic breech through the polycrete ceiling. 
Roots, as wide as tree trunks themselves, drip down from the ceiling and trail 
over the floor. The fine craftsmanship of the tiled blue and white floor is 
lost amid the hair-like off-shoots taking up most of the space, although arched 
and claustrophobic paths exist amid the lengthy roots. Glistening and glowing 
amid the dangling appendages is silvery-blue #6luminescent moss#0.

Alcoved Personnel Dormitory~
   The design of this room is simple but functional, with everything having a 
place in the spacious living quarters. A series of alcoves line the walls, 
each inset with thin mats and surprisingly tidy blankets, most of them still 
bearing small once-white pillows. The walls are painted a serene pale green 
hue and the floor is covered by dusty beige carpet, untouched by time still 
bearing a few child's toys strewn about. Sounds from the rest of the compound 
are muffled by the insulated polyprop walls and a long, flat monitor rests, 
inset just above the doorway leading back into the messhall. 
   Crawling over the wall and into the creases of the ceiling is 
#6bioluminescent moss#0. Some of the sleeping cubicles have been dominating, 
showing like stars in the darkness. It has also eaten through a few of the 
blankets.

A Spacious Lounge Area~
   Once-pristine and now dingy white carpet covers the floors of this vaguely 
circular room. The ceiling in this part of the room remains intact thought 
stained, watermarks showing on the warm grey paint. The walls have been set 
with 'windows', each depicting different outdoors scenes in still glowing 
holo-display. #6Blue-green luminescent moss#0 drapes like glowing living 
curtains over the walls, from the ceilings, even on scattered tables in the 
area.

A Large and Grimy Shower Room~
   Tiles line the floors of this combined shower and bathroom. Though they 
were once a pale grey, they've grown darker and murkier in shade due to years 
of mold buildup. The grout between each tile has gone from crisp white to dull 
brown. The tiles stretch upward from the floor to about four feet, with the 
rest of the wall and the ceiling painted a warm grey hue. Curtains of thick 
ropy #6luminescent moss#0 hang from the ceiling and drape along the shower 
spigots, glowing an eerie blue-green.

Plant Specimen Processing~
   This plain tiled floor appears cracked in a few places and is heavily caked 
with grime and what was probably once plant matter that has decomposed and 
dehydrated into little more than murky brown stains. Once-white walls crafted 
of polycrete are yellowed with age and dust. Instructional posters line the 
walls, displaying usage of a large defunct processing machine bearing tiers 
upon tiers of cracked empty vials. Thick moss drapes like decoration over one 
remaining molded into the wall and hangs in thick ropes down from the cracked 
ceiling, #6glowing#0 faintly with some natural luminescence.

Eastern Hydroponics and Flora Laboratory~
   This room, dark as it is and cast in an eerily faint and blue light, shows 
little sign of recent activity. What can be seen of it reveals a sprawling 
laboratory that stretches out a vast distance to the west and south. Polycrete 
tables rise up from the ground in an orderly grid format throughout the area, 
bearing a plethora of laboratory equipment and long hydroponics trays placed 
under narrow pipes with narrow misting nozzles on their ends. A handful of 
different pieces of equipment have been utterly smashed by polycrete chucks of 
various size, evidently displaced by the roots of trees that punch through the 
ceiling. A testament to this area's disuse, the glass casings of ceiling 
lights lie shattered upon the ground, appearing untouched since they fell to 
the ground. #4Bioluminescent moss#0 has found a habitat upon the danker 
portions of this room, emitting an eery light.

Southeastern Hydroponics and Flora Laboratory~
   This room hosts no invasive roots, though it has not been spared from the 
rampant growth above its ceiling. The metal-and-polycrete framework at the far 
southern end of the lab has crumbled and a massive quantity of soil has flooded 
into the room, stacked up nearly to the ceiling at the southern border but 
remaining nearly at ankle length through this portion of the laboratory. Plant 
life has taken hold within this soil, spreading nearly through the room. The 
high-grade equipment through the room has resisted destruction from this 
development, and rows of storage containers and laboratory tables line the 
area, rising from the growth.

Central Hydroponics and Flora Laboratory~
   This is clearly the hub of what was -and is, to an extent- an impressive 
laboratory. The area is noticeably vacant of individual study workspaces, it 
is instead dominated by large cold-storage units, well-protected mainframes, 
and analysis units. Many of the constructs throughout the room reach nearly to 
the ceiling, and very few are damaged by the sparse number of roots that 
puncture through the ceiling. Near the base of a few mainframes there are dark 
scorch marks upon the floor and several broken tools are scattered upon the 
floor. A very dim light emanates from #4bioluminescent moss#0 that has found 
sparse purchase for life around the few roots that invade the area.

Northwestern Hydroponics and Flora Laboratory~
   This region of the laboratory is quite nearly riddled by roots that drive 
clear from the ceiling to the floor, forming a vast sprawl of organic pillars 
and stalactites. The air throughout is noticeably more humid than the 
surrounding areas, and the bluish illuminating glow is more intense with 
#4bioluminescent moss#0's nearly-rampant growth along the dampened and dirtied 
polycrete. To the west the density of roots reduces to almost nothing, and the 
#4moss#0's light is swallowed by darkness. Scattered among roots and pieces of 
debris stand multiple tables that bear plant specimen upon them. Some specimen 
have found life amidst dirt and roots, while others lie as mere husks upon the 
operating tables, or as entirely decomposed soil.

Western Hydroponics and Flora Laboratory~
   Clearly designed for the purpose of studying flora intensely, this room is 
entirely filled with tables - mostly housing panels lined with soil and bearing 
misting nozzles near their tops, but also with computer terminals set upon the 
end of each table. This portion of lab appears intact, with no trace of 
failure upon the ceiling and very few signs of use throughout the area. 
Various other devices and tools for plant assessment are carefully positioned, 
and the limp husks of many plants are visible from the flora tables.

Pristine Pond Amidst Forest Within a Glass Dome~
   Vivid green-leafed trees of varied species crowd and twine together, 
twisting up to almost brush the glass-like thick polyprop dome that curves over 
the makeshift forest. They thin somewhat around a pristine pond, creating an 
aura of only sparse grasses leading up to the bank. The water is mirrored and 
free from taint, reflecting the sky in slightly distorted fashion. The domed 
forest remains unnervingly quiet, due in part to a lack of wildlife. The only 
sound is the occasional 'swish-swish' of air regulators cutting on and off. 
Decorative white and yellow flowers grow in clumps here and there, growing in 
numbers closer to the water.

A Quiet, Glass-Contained Grove~
   Several species of trees populate this area, swaying in manufactured breezes 
and resting beneath the overlaying thick and clear polyprop dome. The green is 
overwhelming, a shocking contrast to outside of the dome, to the endless 
horizon of bland and dull moonscape. Though perhaps overgrown as a few of the 
taller branches brush at the glass-like covering, they appear largely in good 
health. A distinct lack of wildlife leads to an unnerving quiet, broken only 
by the 'swish-swish' of air regulators cutting on and off. The ground is 
littered with a carpet of fallen leaves layered over sparse patchy grass.
