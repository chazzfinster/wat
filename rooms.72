A Hallway Outside of the Boarding Bay~
   Sweeping and spacious, the metallic sheen could be any number of alloys but 
the polyprop intercepting and joining the well-formed pieces looks to be thick 
and solid. The floors are corrugated, offering grip to allow for safe 
movement. The southward leads to a continuation of hallways marked with 
intersection. A large vaulted ceiling stretches westward, appearing to be a 
boarding bay.

Through a Metallic Hallway~
   Sweeping and spacious, the hallway bearing arc instead of hard lines, this 
stretch carries a metallic sheen that could be a number of alloys. Polyprop 
pieces connect the smooth line, at midway and then again at floor level. The 
floor is corrugated, offering grip to allow for safe movement. A small sign is 
settled into a plaque at the doorway, reading #2Westenders Pub#0.

Westenders Pub~
   The walls crafted in muted dura-wood, this space harkens back to a 
traditional English pub with several differences speaking of ignorance. The 
floor is rubberized, offering a soft landing for anyone on their way down, and 
given a tacky not requiring spilled drinks to further embellish. 'Windows' 
that serve not as windows but as screens to different scenes shift from sifting 
sands to waving palms to the middle of the forest. Synthetic beer smell has 
been applied, made somehow more strange and pleasant by the hint of flowers on 
the tail-end.

At an Intersection~
   The hallway splits into four directions here. The north leads back to the 
'#2Boarding Bay#0' while the east and south move deeper into the ship. Beside 
the door westward is a polyprop sign painted with the words, '#2Kitchen and 
Mess Hall#0' on it. The same metallic corrugated surface makes up the floor 
and the ceiling remains vaulted, roomy for the smaller ship.

A Spacious Mess Hall~
   The floors of this room have, instead of the normal corrugated metal, thick 
rubbery polyprop for ease of cleaning. Spacious as the rest of the ship is, 
long tables have been bolted into the floor in rows, enough for the crew and 
passengers to eat in shifts. Stylized images of Venus and the Moon shift back 
and forth on inner-lit screens.

A Shipboard Kitchen~
   A mixture of chrion surfaces and white polyprop walls, this room appears 
clean and sanitary. Hoods over the counters offer excellent ventilation above, 
while the textured polyprop of the floor offers grip for movement. Stylized 
images of Venus and the Moon shift back and forth on inner-lit screens mounted 
into the walls, offering a dull glow.

Intersection of Corridors~
   This area is simply a perpendicular convergence of two corridors, crossing 
each other and then leading off in their respective directions. No widening of 
the area is present, though the corners have been rounded rather than jutting 
out at sharp points. The walls have a bright and reflective surface, with a 
light frosting on the large, square panels to avoid the infinite mirror effect. 
The floor is bright white and a rubberized, textured material.

Corridor Aft of an Intersection~
   Footsteps through this corridor would be muffled by the bright white, 
rubberized floor. There is no interruption to the monotonous pattern of the 
heavy, lightly frosted squares that make up the otherwise reflective walls. 
Further on to the aft, there appears to be two doors pressed into the sides, 
while the main intersection stands visible to the fore.

polished reflective walls, a rubberized bright white floor with texturing to 
prevent slipping, and a ceiling that matches the bulkheads. This portion, 
however, allows passage between two blast doors, one on each side. Further 
towards the aftside of the ship are elevator doors, blocking the entirety of 
the hall.

Just Fore of an Elevator~
   The consistent look of lightly frosted reflective walls and rubberized, 
white floor ends at a landing. Set into the aftside wall are sliding, thick 
metal doors that open into the elevator. Next to them is a control console, 
with three circles each bearing one mark: E, H, and B. Further towards the 
fore part of the ship the corridor continues, giving little to see in that 
direction except more of the same. 

Painted on the starboard wall in bright block lettering is: "#6HABITATION 
DECK#0".

Turn in a Corridor~
   Here, the corridor veers off abruptly towards the aft, the transition 
softened by the fact that there are no corners. Only curves. Extending 
further from here is the continuation of the heavy, metal panels covered in 
artificial frost. An expanse of unbroken, almost reflective walls, save for 
the striking white of the rubberized floor. 

Blast doors are installed along the starboard wall of this lengthy corridor. 
Painted on the wall in a sharp white are the words, "#6STARBOARD 
DORMITORIES#0".

A Turn in the Corridor~
   Here is a rounded turn in the corridor, except for the softened corners 
little differentiates it from the rest of the corridors. Further to starboard 
is a straight portion, much like this one without the bend. Just further to 
the aft it looks the same: reflective, metal walls and rubberized bright white 
flooring. 

This is the beginning of a corridor of sliding doors leading further to the aft 
side, and painted on the wall in a sharp white is the indicative: "#6PORT 
DORMITORIES#0".

interrupted only by sliding doors. The textured floor is of a thick rubberized 
material, a commercial sharp white color from end to end. The walls are 
covered in artificial frost, otherwise reflective.

safe travelling. Sliding doors can be seen, flush with the port wall.

hallway have been rounded off, a small feature of safety in the circumstance of 
collision.

striking white, both rubberized and textured to provide a firm step along it. 
Sliding doors lay along the starboard wall, the hallway continuing to both the 
fore and aft sides. Walking is muffled throughout.

   Just to the aft of here, the rounded corners give way to an intersection 
leading in the four main directions. The walls are polished and reflective, 
made of heavy metal squares with a light frosting over them and held in place 
by bulkheads. It is reasonably quiet, most sounds the occasional shift of 
something far off, or a dull thump. Footsteps are muffled by the rubberized 
texture of the floor.

   Continuing on between fore and aft uninterrupted, the sides of this hallway

heavy metal squares covered in an artficial frost, sturdily held into place. 
The floor, by contrast, is a bright white, rubberized and textured surface 
allowing a good grip.

frost that covers the otherwise reflective squares that have been secured into 
place with bulkheads. The sharp odor of chlorine could be detected to the 
fore. Someways to the aft, an intersection branches off in all directions. 

A metal plaque on the starboard door marks it as "#6SHOWERS, LOCKERS, AND

A long counter rests near the northern edge of the room and behind it are 
several technicians that can be found performing an array of varying office 
duties. Several large touchscreen monitors have been mounted into the eastern 
wall and they list a variety of different jobs, employment contracts, and

Menkent Shuttle Bay Entry Hall~
   This enormous hall has a massive transparent dome over the top, supported by 
a mass of rods of a dark grey metal with glinting veins of silver, all twisted 
into an impressive series of sculptured looking beams. To the west, the hall 
narrows into a large corridor that leads deeper into the facility, while the 
city is accessible to the south through a huge set of automatic #6sliding 
doors#0 and an impressive looking reception desk stands along the eastern wall. 
The floor here is polycrete, buffed to a high sheen and squeaks slightly 
underfoot, hideously fashionable with its faux-industrial feel. All available 
wall space is taken up with advomercial screens and a number of 3D holograms 
pop up all around, aggressively advertising an assortment of products and 
services.

shuttle bay can be seen to the southeast. An archway made of sculptured metal 
rods takes up most of the southern wall, leading deeper into the shuttle bay 
while a number of 3D holograms demand attention, cycling through adverts for 
various bars around the city and products offered by the many corporations.

An Imposing, Domed Hall~
   A corridor to the south opens up with little warning into this vast room, 
perfectly circular with polycrete floors that have been polished to a 
marble-like sheen. An enormous plexiglass dome covers the entire ceiling, 
shored up with sculptured metal rods in the same style as the archways that 
lead off to the north, east and west, a very dark grey shot through with silver 
veins that glint slightly when they catch the light. The number of 3D 
holograms here is nearly overwhelming and advomercials play constantly on huge 
screens set into the curved walls between the archways, bombarding the viewer 
with products and services.

Menkent Shuttle Bay High Speed Transit Tube Station~
   The polished polycrete floors of this room creep right up to the edges of 
the vast plexiglass tubes that stand in the middle, clustered together. A 
sliding door is set into the side of each tube, opening when the high speed 
transit shuttle that provides transport around the city arrives. The curved 
walls here are made up of a vast number of screens set in metal surrounds, all 
cycling through a constant stream of brightly coloured, attention-grabbing 
advomercials that feature everything from sonic toothbrushes to jobs available 
with the various corporations.

Surface Shuttle Launch Pad~
   This room branches off from the main space of the bay through a sculptured 
archway of dark grey metal rods. The curved walls are panels of plexiglass, 
the swirling, cloud-filled sky beyond visible for miles and the curve of 
another shuttle bay can be made out to the northwest, while set into the 
eastern wall is a transparent door that slides aside to allow a shuttle to 
dock. Perhaps strangely, there are no advomercial screens or 3D holograms 
here, a commercial assault on the senses conspicuously absent.

An Impressively Wide, Vaulted Corridor~
   Wide enough to accommodate a crowd, this corridor stretches northwards 
towards a sculptured metal archway. The floor underfoot is polycrete, polished 
to high shine and walls are made up of alternating panels, some of plexiglass 
through which other parts of the sky city can be seen, nestled amongst the 
clouds and the rest are floor-to-ceiling advomercial screens that shamelessly 
and endlessly flaunt their products to any and all passersby.

A Wide, Vaulted Corridor~
   The arched ceiling of this corridor is plexiglass, set between spokes of 
matte metal of a very dark grey, not too far from the shade of the polished 
polycrete floor which has an almost marble effect to it. The cloud-filled 
skies outside visible for miles through the plexiglass panels, the scenic 
natural beauty in direct opposition to the bright and flashing advomercials 
that cycle on alternate panels that stretch right up to the transparent ceiling 
above.

A Generously Sized Office~
   This space is curved, almost circular but for the door. The walls are 
plain, matte metal interrupted at intervals by floor-to-ceiling panels of 
plexiglass and the floor is covered with a nanofiber carpet of a very dark 
grey, almost black. There are no pictures or ornamentation in the room, but 
circles of white, opaque glass that omit a pale, soft Light are set into the 
walls. They range in size from pinprick to as large as a hand and are arranged 
in a series of swooping spirals.

   With its vaulted, transparent ceiling, this corridor is both impressive and 
maybe a little intimidating, large enough to easy provide space for a decent 
sized crowd. The polished polycrete underfoot has a swirling, marble-like feel 
to it, seamless and stretching out ahead while the walls are made up entirely 
of alternating panels, plexiglass windows interrupted by full height screens 
that assault the eyes with a series of bright and neverending advomercials.

Outside Menkent Shuttle Bay~
   Looming ahead to the north is the huge structure of the shuttle bay, metal 
girders inlaid with plexiglass, gentle curves and domes set in artfully 
architectural juxtaposition with sharp angles and sloping roofs. Two slender, 
willowy looking trees with delicately silvery leaves are set into circular 
planters to either side of a pair of massive #6sliding doors#0, a brief break 
in the duraslate tiles that make up the floor of this. They are cutting into 
seemingly random shapes that nonetheless fit together like an enormous mosaic, 
a myriad of soft greys, whites and almost peach hues in places. This area is 
part of an enormous circular island, connected to other parts of the city by 
suspended walkways, a bustling hub of activity.

Alnair Island Meeting Point~
   Alnair Island continues here, the grey and white duraslate tiles underfoot 
mirroring the colours of the clouds that surround the floating platform. To 
the north is small building built of black synthetic marble, very much in the 
shadow of the glass and metal structure of its neighbour while far to the 
southeast, another branch of buildings can be seen, connected to this island 
via some kind of suspended walkway. Never quiet, this area seems to be 
something of a meeting point, groups forming and then drifting apart while 
adroids whizz around frantically, delivering a stream of personalised 
advomercials to anybody who doesn't look busy.

Northeast Curve Of Alnair Island~
   This is the edge of the circular platform that makes up Alnair Island, 
rimmed with twisted metal posts strung with metal cables that make up railings 
that reach to a little above waist height. To the northeast, another arm of 
the city is apparently still under construction, a number of hover cranes 
extending up into the sky and to the southeast is the main bulk of the city. 
Directly east, nothing but sky is visible for miles and miles, breathtakingly 
beautiful and a break from the incessant murmurings of the adroids.

railings, the sky is uninterrupted to the east, opening out beyond the two 
other arms of the sky city while southwards, the start of a wide, suspended 
walkway is visible.

the centre and the ledge above it. A series of heavy metal letters spell out 
'Alnair Centre' and sit on the ledge over the door, burnished to a deep black 
tinged with purple. Westward, the plexiglass tubes of the transit system can 
be seen and the rest of the plaza continues in the other directions.

   The vast plexiglass tubes of the high speed transit system are set into the 
western edge of the platform, a sliding door opening into each one. Not far to 
the north, the imposing structure of the shuttle bay looms and the southern 
part of the curve is hemmed in by a wall that acts as a view screen. With the 
traffic from the tubes, this space is always busy and has a frantic feel, not 
helped by the adroids, who continue their assault on the senses.

One End Of A Suspended Walkway~
   This suspended walkway hangs from the southeastern curve of Alnair Island 
and sweeps around to connect it to another circular platform at the end of it. 
The smooth metal walls of a building are visible to the west although well out 
of reach and to the east the sky stretches out beyond the gleaming metal 
railings. The duraslate mosaic of the island gives way to textured metal tiles 
with plenty of grip.

Corner Of A Suspended Walkway~
   More a curve than a corner, the suspended walkway continues here, sheltered 
entirely by buildings to the west and south, with the open sky visible on the 
other side of the railings. Perhaps a glimpse of some of the under workings of 
the sky city can be caught from the right angle, just as impressive as the 
habitable areas. Foot traffic is constant, but the walkway is more than wide 
enough to accommodate a stream of people, even when the city is at its busiest.

Where The End Of A Suspended Walkway Joins A Platform~
   From here, the suspended platform of Alnair Island is visible to the 
northwest and Epsilon Centauri Island is directly east. The curve of it is 
marked by a band of metal, where the ground underfoot changes from the textured 
metal tiles of the walkway to black faux-granite. Across the massive space of 
empty sky visible to the north, another arm of the city can be seen, surrounded 
by hover cranes and still clearly under construction.

Outside The Holocinema~
   Lined by plants, the dark faux-granite continues onwards past a grandoise 
building to the east. Holoposters beg for attention from underneath a mighty 
overhang that scrolls movie titles by in a crisp holo-text. The posters flash 
advertisements for movies and holoplays. Between the clamoring holoposters are 
a series of three wide double doors composed out of synthwood oak through which 
a constant stream of civilians pass through, eagerly discussing their intended 
film, or previous ones. Little cute-as-a-button hoverdroids whir about four or 
five feet off the ground, accosting passers-by with taglines from movies and 
prices for snacks.

Epsilon Cantina Serving Area~
   The back half of this room houses an open plan kitchen on an industrial 
scale, black topped counters around the edge. It is separated from the other 
half by another counter which can be accessed via a hatch, on top of which is a 
shelving unit of many compartments that can be loaded from the kitchen. The 
front of the compartments open automatically when a hand comes into close 
contact, allowing customers to slide out the little trays of freshly cooked, 
neatly packaged food in exchange for the correct payment. Further along is a 
drinks dispenser and another unit that spits out packaged cutlery, napkins and 
condiments after a tap of the touch screen.

Epsilon Cantina Restaurant Area~
   The glass front of this building lets in a lot of light so this huge, 
high-ceilinged room feels airy and larger than it really is. The floor is 
textured, made of some kind of polyrubber of swirling red and the walls are 
white, huge frames mounted on them in which corporation logos and brightly 
coloured adverts cycle endlessly. Rows of long tables with benches to either 
side of them stand neatly, their tops a vivid green and metal shaded lights 
hang on long cables from the ceiling. Plants in pots around the edges of the 
room add to the cheerful air of this space and hidden speakers play a variety 
of happy but rather bland instrumentals.

Epsilon Centauri Island, Near A Walkway~
   To the west, a suspended walkway joins the edge of this huge circular 
platform. The southern part is entirely surrounded by buildings that butt 
right up to the curve, but northern side is open to the sky and great curved 
wall of faux-marble with elegantly carved balustrades follows the entire length 
of it, while the top is more than wide enough to sit on. The floor here is 
slick, black and seamless faux-granite, inlaid with stars of polished moon 
rock, although even this grand space is at the mercy of the corporations' 
adroids and holographic projectors, which circle passersby in a predatory 
fashion.

Epsilon Centauri View Point~
   This part of the curve extends the furthest into the sky, a blanket of 
clouds obscuring the planet far below from view although occasional flashes of 
green can be glimpsed through the swirling mists. The obnoxiously ostentatious 
faux-marble wall continues here, the constantly milling crowds drawn to lean on 
it and to gaze out over the clouds before returning to other parts of the 
platform where other, less subtle pleasures than the view can be enjoyed.

   Set into this part of the platform is a break in the somewhat unforgiving 
black of the faux-granite, a raised decking area made of dark, engineered wood 
beams built a step higher than the surrounding area. Long rectangular planters 
built of a brushed chrion sit in sharp contrast with the smooth curves of the 
rest of the platform, boasting an impressive array of lush green plants with 
vividly bright flowers and too perfectly shaped leaves, bedded down in a thick 
layer of neon green hydroponic gel.

surrounding plexiglass windows, through which a bright room with rows of tables 
can be glimpsed. The faux-granite is unbroken here, but for the expertly 
crafted starts that are inset within it. The general hustle continues here, 
this area seemingly a popular route to and from places, rarely entirely devoid 
of people.

The Centre Of Epsilon Centauri Island~
   In the very centre of the island, the star-strewn black faux-granite 
underfoot gives way to an enormous circular planter of brushed chrion, 
massively thick and filled with a black, glass-like substance that encases the 
roots of a tree. The tree itself is huge, unnaturally straight and no doubt 
bio-engineered, its trunk dead straight and smooth until it splits into a 
glorious crown of widely spaced branches with almost star shaped leaves of 
silvery green leaves. Southwards, the platform is entirely surrounded by 
buildings while to the north, the great open expanse of sky in which the city 
is suspended can be seen.

outwards on hydraulic hinges, the words 'The Blue Star Bar' projected in a 3D

clearly made out in the filigree of the metal that depicts the galaxy, another 
suspended walkway visible through it, snaking further south and away from the 
noise and bustle of the island. Black metal planters stand to either side of 
the gate, sprouting seemingly identical saplings with poker straight trunks and 
unnaturally symmetrical branches with clusters of soft green leaves and 
delicate white blossoms.

   The eastern wall of this space is curved, set with a pair of double doors 
and huge windows made of textured plexiglass, a spiral staircase that leads 
upwards nestled in the southern corner. The bar sits along the northern wall, 
the space behind it mirrored and then lined with shelves that house a number of 
capsules containing liquids in a myriad of hues. The countertop is unbroken 
slab of engineered marble, edged with black and set atop a base of the same 
dark wood as the herringbone patterned floor and the walls papered in a chalky 
blue with subtle gold patterns. Chandeliers and a huge mirror in an ornate 
frame lend a rather forced, ostentatiously vintage feel to this room, which 
continues westward.

of lights surround the stage. The tables and chairs are arranged around the 
edge of the room to leave a space in the centre free for dancing and speaker 
grills are set seamlessly into the walls to project both live and recorded 
music as needed.

A Gleaming Chrion Kitchen~
   Where visible, the walls of this room are painted white although much of the 
space is taken up with chrion. Chrion panels, chrion shelves, chrion counters 
with slick black tops and inset with gleaming electric hobs and neat little 
sinks. Various cooking gadgets and contraptions line the walls, plenty of pans 
neatly hanging from circular racks that hang overhead but just within reach. 
There is one window to the south that looks out over rolling fields of clouds 
and a complicated looking ventilation system in the eastern wall that whirrs 
and hums endlessly.

A Cozy, Secluded Staff Room~
   Although the whirr of the ventilation system in the room below is audible, 
it doesn't detract from the relaxed vibe of this room, which overlooks the sky 
and more of the city through a window to the south. The walls are painted a 
soft grey, bare but not stark and the floor is covered with a hardwearing 
nanofibre carpet in a much darker grey. Plain and functional, it houses a few 
sofas and chairs, plus a series of lockers against one wall and a wide plasma 
screen on one wall.

The Blue Star Bar Female Toilets~
   A cozy, windowless space, this room is lined with a row of faux wood stalls 
along one wall and a series of porcelain sinks along with other, each with a 
gold framed mirror. The chandelier hanging from the ceiling is small and 
rather glitzy for a bathroom, the light it provides soft and flattering. 
Despite the old fashioned feel of the room, the fixtures and fittings are 
clearly new and well made.

Upstairs Landing Of The Blue Star Bar~
   This spacious landing is airy, light filtering in through the massive 
plexiglass windows which stretch up from the floor below and continue to the 
one above. The walls are painted rather than papered but in the same shade of 
chalky, vintage blue as the paper downstairs and the chandeliers have been 
replaced with more modest globes of glass that glow softly. A few pictures of 
stars hang in frames on the walls, set between two doors the same dark wood as 
the herringbone floors, the southern one marked 'F' and the western, 'M'.

porcelain sinks, each set below a gold framed mirror. Light is provided by a 
glitzy looking chandelier and the place has an old fashioned feel, despite 
being clearly new. The walls are the same blue as the rest of the bar and the 
floor the same dark wood herringbone that matches the stalls.

   The herringbone of lower floors gives way here to plain boards of dark, 
engineered wood although the walls are still painted in that same vintage blue. 
The huge windows provide light, leaving this space feeling airy, if somewhat 
empty and plain after the lower floors, the lighting just a few simple glass 
globes fixed to the otherwise bare walls.

   Clearly not intended for customer use, this lounge is plain and functional. 
The walls have been painted grey and the floor is made of dark, wide boards of 
engineered wood, all the knots and whorls expertly fashioned. A window in the 
western wall overlooks sky and the shape of another building somewhere to the 
west, entirely cut off from the rest of the city.

Carpeted with a neutral coloured expanse of some kind of stiff nanofibred material, this room is very plain. The walls are white, as is the ceiling, which houses a series of small lights that have been recessed into it and can be dimmed via a control panel to one side of the door. The southern window is large, reaching from floor to ceiling with a series of filmy looking curtains that can be pulled back to provide privacy, the view of the clouds fairly breathtaking.

with a backlit mirror behind it, everything clean but fairly spartan. A small 
shelf has been mounted on one wall and a window is set in another, although the 
glass is frosted and nothing can be seen beyond it.

A State Of The Art Surgery~
   Relentlessly white, this windowless room is perfectly round, the doors 
curved to fit its shape. The white walls are barely visible due to all the 
equipment which is fitted to it and includes a multitude of touch screen and 
voice activated panels, monitoring equipment, mechanised arms and other medical 
gadgets that are all gleamingly clean. In the centre of the space is the 
intimidatingly high-tech surgery table set under a complicated rig of bright 
lights can be minutely adjusted via a control panel. Carefully climate 
controlled, this room remains unfalteringly cool and entirely odourless.

   The beds in this room are arranged carefully to leave a clear passage from 
the swinging doors to the curved one, opaque sheets of a filmy polymesh hanging 
from rings on railings above to allow sections to be curtained off. A 
complicated array of medical equipment surrounds each bed and a large machine 
mounted to one wall dispenses hyposyringes, IV lines, bandages and a number of 
other medical miscellaneous items that might be needed. The floor is made of a 
poured white polyresin, flawlessly smooth and the walls, where visible are also 
a gleaming white.

A Hospital Bathroom~
   This room is compact and extremely clean, the white polyresin floor 
gleamingly clean and the white fixtures equally spotless. A counter runs along 
the back wall opposite the #6door#0, seamlessly housing an oval shaped basin 
which is moulded directly into the polyplastic, a large, softly back-lit 
#6mirror#0 spanning the space behind it. The toilet sits discreetly on one 
wall next to a rail to allow less able users to utilise it more easily and on 
the other side from that is an especially large sonic shower. Encased in a 
curved panel of plexiglass with a door to allow access, it contains another 
rail-assisted seat within easy reach of the touch pad used to operate it.

A Gleaming White Hospital Ward~
   White polyresin floors meet the glossy white walls in a gentle curve, this 
room devoid of proper corners. Rows of beds are lined up neatly, each one 
partitioned off from the next by filmy curtains of opaque polymesh that can be 
pulled across for privacy. Each bed is neatly made with crisp white hygi-linen 
and surrounded by an inordinate amount of machinery and electronics, a plasma 
screen built into the foot of each one to display patient information. Even 
the metal frames of the beds are coated with glossy white and the large floor 
to ceiling windows have white shades pulled over them so that little colour 
breaks the monotonous sterility of this space.

Hospital Reception And Transit Tube Area~
   All along the northern wall and set on either side a pair of double, 
swinging doors are the huge, tinted plexiglass surrounds of the #6transit 
system#0, the tubes announcing their arrival or departure with a hydraulic 
hiss. In the centre of the room stands an enormous circular desk of glossy 
white polyprop, with the inside section raised a step or so off the ground. 
This seeming impregnable fortress houses the hospital's computer and 
communications systems, as well as several well trained, clearly bio-engineered 
plants in hydroponic pots. Everything here is almost overpoweringly white, 
from the poured polyresin floors to the walls and high ceilings, every corner 
rounded off and smoothed away to make it easier to keep impeccably clean.

A Hospital Waiting Area~
   The gleaming white of the rest of the hospital continues here although large 
holoposters advertising various drugs and implants are lined up neatly on the 
walls, giving this area a vaguely less severe feeling. Set into the northern 
wall is an slightly curved door and along the southern one, an ergonomically 
designed staircase allows access to the next floor. It looks somehow over 
engineered, the corners rounded away for easy cleaning and the railing on the 
side a moulded length of white polyplastic set on plexiglass panels. At the 
end of the room is a a huge plexiglass window with rounded off corners, a view 
of the rest of the city visible far away, connected only by the high transit 
tubes which shuttle endlessly back and forth.

Hallway And Staircase~
   This ergonomically designed staircase continues up and down, each step 
rounded off and painted with some kind of substance that, while not appearing 
any different, provides extra traction underfoot. A square window with rounded 
corners in the southern wall provides a view of the cloud-filled sky and the 
high speed transit tube links, a suspended walkway with its linked buildings 
just visible far, far in the distance. The walls, floor and ceiling are white, 
everything sterile and featureless but for two small digital plaques. The one 
next to the north door reads 'Office' and the one next to the west proclaims it 
to be an 'Examination Room'.

   Square white tiles cover the floor of this room, a tiny diamond shaped grey 
tile set at the centre of each one. This space is large, bright despite the 
lack of windows in this area, lit by circular glass lights embedded in the high 
ceiling. The wall space has been divided into full length panels which phase 
slowly between images of honed, athletic bodies engaged in various different 
kinds of sports and activities, interrupted by the inevitable advomercials of 
associated products.

enormous screen that cycles through adverts for the various products sold in 
the shop, all displayed with obsessive neatness on the plexiglass shelves. 
Those and the glass-fronted cabinets are expertly lit with an unfaltering white 
light, while the lights overhead are slightly dimmer as if to draw attention to 
the displays of sports related goods.

   A wide staircase leads down from here, plenty of room for four or so people 
to ascend or descend at any one time. Past the staircase, the southern wall is 
just one big window, a small outside area with a couple of tables visible 
before a low wall and then a huge expanse of space and cloud with another arm 
of the city way off in the distance to the south, a tall building with many 
windows climbing up into the sky.

A Secluded Outdoor Patio~
   Wide, engineered wood boards make up this decking area, which is fairly 
small, curving outwards at the southern edge. The wall there is low, made of 
irregular slabs of synthetic stone and reaching almost to chest height, tall 
enough to prevent unintentional falls and probably about the right height to 
lean on. Beyond it is sky and the swirling masses of clouds like fields that 
carpet the space up to another arm of the city that curves around from the east 
to the south, the furthest building away straight and tall, towering above much 
of the rest of the surroundings.

A Walkway, North Of Alnair Island~
   To the west is the side of a building and then the shape of the shuttle port 
towering behind that, all glass and metal and impressive from this angle. The 
walkway continues a little further east, leaving the bustle of Alnair Island 
behind. There seems to be activity there, but it's a different and the 
meticulously built, careful finish of the city gives way to what looks like a 
construction site of kinds, complete with hovercranes and the sound of building 
work is audible, even from here.

Entering A Construction Area~
   This part of the walkway sticks out past the boundaries of Alnair Island, 
the outer curve of it almost directly south along with another huge floating 
platform past that that continues eastward. Much of the city is visible from 
here, an abundance of plexiglass panels and windows set in buildings of 
gleaming metal and textured faux-stone all curled around a great open space 
where clouds bubble and brew like an ocean. North though, things are 
different. A huge chain link fence with a gate seems to block progress in that 
direction although a construction site can be seen through it, along with piles 
of metal girders, piles of building materials and mysterious, wrapped pallets 
lying around.

The Start Of A Sprawling Construction Area~
   A towering chain link fence entirely surrounds this small platform, 
separating it from the walkway connecting it to the rest of the city. The 
floor underfoot is just a rough layer of raw, rough polycrete, totally 
unfinished and intended to be paved, judging by the thick synthetic stone slabs 
which are neatly packaged in polyplastic wrappers and stacked in pallets 
against the fence. The organised chaos of building materials continue to the 
east, while northwards stands a compact building that seems to be some kind of 
temporary structure.

The Corner Of A Construction Site~
   The view of the city to the southeast is obscured by a thin plastic screen 
that wraps around the outside of the chainlink fence, no doubt in place to keep 
this area out of sight as much as possible. Dozens of metal panels are secured 
under polyprop sheets and slotted into racks that stand up against the fence to 
keep them in place, while unopened boxes are also carefully stacked up and 
ready for use. Perhaps oddly and in a break from the otherwise fairly ordered 
arrangement of things, a section of boxes have been pulled out and forwards 
rather haphazardly.

   Polyprop sheeting has been suspended over a partially built frame that might 
be the start of a building, leaving this area covered over, although it's still 
fairly at the mercy of the wind which creeps in through all the gaps. The 
rough polycrete floor is dirty and marked with boot prints and robot tracks 
dragged through the dust and a couple of long tables have been dragged into 
place here, looking somewhat out of place.

a complex looking system of hydraulic scaffolding. There's an area next to it 
that looks like a docking area for a small platform that services the

of bristling metal girders, its shape and purpose still unidentifiable.

   Not very different from its storefront, holoposters have been installed all 
throughout this portion of the Birdun Virtual Reality Centre. Any details of 
the walls themselves are impossible to determine as they are completely 
overtaken by holoposters that dance with color and light, aggressively 
insistent as they endlessly scroll through their queue of advertisements. Set 
against the southern wall is a large, vibrant monitor and console that dwarfs 
all other screens here. A pleasant, electronic voice pitches over the hum of 
the various posters here and audibly welcomes newcomers into the facility as 
they continue eastwards.

Birdun Virtual Reality Centre~
   Eight hexagonal platforms of durable black polyprop material litter the wide 
inner chamber of the Birdun Virtual Reality Centre, clustering together 
cylindrical pods in a honeycomb fashion and offsetting them only a few inches 
from the herringbone-patterned floor. Each platform is equipped with four pods 
that open out in the cardinal directions. The majority of the pods appear in 
use, sliding doors closed and locked, veiling the identities of the occupants 
inside. Overhead, several diamond-shaped lamps bathe the room in an even, 
comfortable light. The dark walls here are barren of holoposters and the room 
has an oddly quiet and still atmosphere.

glossy, sparkly faux-quartz tiles laid in geometric patterns that lead the eye 
deeper into the building and strategically towards the doors of the various, 
immaculately appointed shops. To the north is one, its window a huge plasma 
screen on which flawlessly dressed models endlessly parade the 
hyper-fashionable contents within, their prancings set against a suitably 
dramatic background of roaring flames.

An Aggressively Fashionable Clothing Shop~
   The walls of this shop are covered in a complicated mosaic of plexiglass 
fronted metal cupboards which contain clothing on the very bleeding edge of 
fashion. Each item is shrink-wrapped in a transparent envelope, rows and rows 
stacked neatly, while the cupboards are separated by floor to ceiling 
holoposters displaying obnoxiously attractive looking models dressed in the 
various items. There is a round #1touch-pad#0 the same bright red as the 
plexiglass-tiled floor that sits under each cupboard, presumably dispensing 
them like some kind of glorified vending machine as the shop seems to lack 
staff of any kind, the electro-pop music blaring away loudly from hidden

A Sleekly Decorated Medical Office~
   Panels of glossy white, moulded polyprop cover the walls of this room, the 
only break a window of opaque plexiglass with rounded corners. They merge into 
the floor, which is curved up at the edges and is also white, apparently 
resistant to scuff marks and so smooth that it gleams when the light catches 
it. A desk, also white, is home to the computer and communications systems as 
well as a strange looking silvery metal ornament that proudly occupies a space 
on the left hand side. On the back wall behind the desk is a large frame with 
a series of rotating images of Lunar landscapes that play on it.

Changing Area In An Examination Room~
   This section of the room has been partitioned off behind a polymesh curtain 
that, while opaque, at least provides some privacy. It is entirely 
featureless, the walls, floor and ceiling a uniform white, the only thing of 
any interest the moulded white polyprop bench that sits on the floor.

A White Examination Room~
   An opaque polymesh curtain blocks of a space one end of this room, serving 
as some kind of changing area. A single examination couch made of a sterile 
white polyvinyl stands with its head against one wall to allow access on either 
side, mounted on a hydraulic stand so that it can be raised or lowered. It's 
perhaps a little imposing, especially with the rig of lights a huge plasma 
screen covering the wall behind it and presumably able to display feeds from 
the multitude of scanning equipment that shares the rounded metal base that 
houses the lights.

   Continuing on from the examination room further to the east, this space is 
filled with complicated and gleaming looking medical equipment, refrigerated 
cabinets and a sleek looking computer system that stands on the transparent, 
moulded plexiglass desk. Instead of windows, the space has rounded panels with 
lights set behind them that admit a soft glow so that even when the lights 
above are turned off, the room is always lit. The floors, walls and ceiling 
are all white, spotlessly clean and bare although a single leafy green plant 
sits one corner in a pot of hydroponic gel, perhaps a little out of place while 
a #6retina scanner#0 is installed in the wall to one side of the door.

the drop surrounded by glass panels with a rounded black railing on top. The 
doors to the north and west are unmarked, the white walls and floor continuing 
but although this area is still clean, it doesn't have the enforced sterility 
of the lower floors and the lights are a little dimmer, making it feel somehow 
more relaxed.

   Clearly a shared facility, this grey painted bathroom boasts a neat row of 
stalls along one wall and a matching row of cubicles on the wall opposite. It 
is divided in the middle by a long, double sided rectangular sink that's almost 
like a trough, split into individual compartments with an uninterrupted length 
of mirror to separate the two sides, space for about eight people either side. 
The window at the far end of the room is unfaltering opaque and the floors are 
a textured black rubberised material, non-slip but easy to clean.

from all around, leaving this area very quite. The windows are covered by 
sleek looking panels that entirely block out the light from outside, but can be 
raised or lowered by pressing a button to one side. Lining the walls are rows 
of compact but comfortable looking pod beds, each with a plexiglass front, half 
of which can be slid back to allow access. They are all equipped with a small, 
rounded light that can be dimmed, and a panel near the head of the bed with a 
button that darkens the glass for privacy and another that links in to the 
communications channels.

of the clouds beyond them.

Deeper Into Muhlifain Mall~
   This part of the mall is really a glorified corridor, even with its faux 
quartz tiles and lines of plants that sit in huge polished polycrete planters 
filled with neon green hydroponic gel. They are carefully arranged so as not 
to be in the way of the frames which sit on the walls, advomercials within 
competing for attention with brightly coloured depictions of their products and 
wittily worded slogans. Many of them babble or play flashy little jingles when 
somebody walks by, meaning this fairly busy route is never quiet and has a 
definite air of hustle to it.

polished durasteel, gleaming against the light. At the far east end is a large 
touch-screen interface counter that sections off the last fourth of the room, 
offering a large variety of menu options. Centered in the eastern wall, a 
plain durasteel door swings on loose hinges.

gleaming durasteel to provide unrelenting support - synthetically assembled 
faux-mahogany planks compose the floor, to lead past a dizzying number of 
holoposters advertising movies, installed behind lush polymesh drapes. Most of 
the illumination is provided by the bright strip lights fixed above almost 
every holoposter. At the corridor's end, a wide archway to the east promises 
snacks and drinks, while the theatres can be reached by way of an 
#6escalator#0.

A Secret, Abandoned Park~
Nestled behind the mall and part of the southeastern arm of the city,
this little space is entirely out of sight of almost anything else and
whether due to bad planning or a mistake, it remains blissfully hidden
and unconnected to anything else. Clearly intended to be a landscaped
garden, the project was abandoned partway, although a few beds and paths
have been outlined and filled with hydroponic gravel and part of a low
wall has been built from duraslate, set in a curve to match the edge
hemmed in by the a taller wall of carved faux-marble.

Thriving bio-engineered grasses and plants with tiny, delicate flowers
flourish in the beds and have already begun to rebel, starting to creep
past the confines of their containers, and a couple of saplings are
growing well. The north and eastern sides boast nearly uninterrupted
views of the sky, just the hovercranes of the construction site sometimes
visible through the clouds although this place has a sereneness and
tranquility about it, even the sounds of people on the walkway past the
metal wall to the south muffled and distant.

Surrounding An Ostentatious Fountain~
   In the centre of this space is a huge fountain, built within a circular 
basin of faux-marble the same glossy white as the tiles underfoot and the 
geometric patterns seem to come to a head here, encircling it in a complicated, 
dizzying tangle of isometric shapes. The fountain itself is huge, reaching 
almost to the ceiling far overhead. Made of beautifully sculpted metal, it is 
cast in the shape of a handsome, curly-haired centaur rearing up while its 
forelegs paw at the air. It wields an elaborately carved bow, the arrow cocked 
to the string and drawn back, biceps bulging although the majestic effect is 
somewhat ruined by the massive Gaiman Corp logo emblazoned on its bare, muscled 
chest. North of here, an escalator looms into the yawning space of the floor 
above, while this long, wide corridor continues east and west.

The Bottom Of A Huge Escalator~
   The huge, diamond paneled plexiglass and chrion roof above is visible here 
in all its glory, arched high above the space. This area is always busy, 
people moving forwards towards the enormous #6escalator#0, which bears them 
graciously and effortlessly aloft, the patterns on the floor subtly seeming to 
point towards it to guide the unsuspecting consumer on towards more commercial 
gluttony on the second tier of the mall. Another brings shoppers back to this 
level, depositing them gently at the bottom, although not without assaulting 
passengers in both directions with a barrage of advomercials, delivered by a 
couple of fixed adroids who regurgitate their messages whenever somebody 
travels past them.

An Exclusive Jewellery Store~
   Despite being plainly decorated, this shop somehow manages to ooze

faux-wood inset with cubes that display the jewellery. Each piece is lit with 
a gentle white glow, set on a small, velvety cushion the exact same shade of 
navy blue as the extremely short pile, nanofibre carpet. Towards the back of 
the room, a desk made of the same faux-wood as the wall panels stands, entirely 
bare of any kind of decoration or technology but still somehow intriguing in 
its sparsity.

   Clearly an exclusive kind of store, the window of the shop to the north is 
entirely blacked out, attention-grabbing mainly in its utter lack of branding 
or logos, other than 'Carbonics' written discreetly above the door in 
tastefully plain letters. A kind of negative space against the backdrop of 
endless, colourful adverts, even the adroids and holograms give it a wide 
berth, no doubt due to some massively expensive contracts drawn up with other 
corporations. Either way, this place positively screams class and the 
stylishly blank, windowless door is nonetheless inviting.

displayed on hover-stands and lit by individual spotlights that illuminate 
gleaming metal and engineered leather. Further east, a set of #6sliding

The Start Of Ma Wai Walk~
   Stretching from just before the wall to the north off towards the south is a 
well maintained street paved with squares of duracrete cut and repositioned to 
create the image of a blazing sun that starts at the midway mark on the side of 
the street and cutting off half of it. Adding to the effect are the colored 
tiles ranging from dark orange for the body of the sun to the bright solar 
flares reaching out from the globe of the sun across the road to the #6sliding 
doors#0 of the Muhlifain Mall, down the road towards the south and even 
climbing the wall. Unlike the flickering lines that lay flush on the street, 
the ones traversing up the wall rise up from the surface, making it uneven to 
the touch.

sun~
   It takes close inspection to see the different tiles and how each was cut to 
fit into the mural of the sun as a whole. Not only are the ones on the outer 
rim of the sun cut, but the ones on the inside are also shaped and laid out in 
such a way as to add to the effect of the rolling magma of the suns surface. 
Blending a clever combination of shapes and colors this sun which starts at the 
edge of the street looks very much like the one that lights the universe. The 
solar flares are done in similar fashion though the colors are a little darker. 
One solar flare lashes off down the street, one across the street and then 
another loops up the wall then back to the sun itself.

   The hole in the wall is big enough to slide the toe of a foot in and gain

wall~
   Standing at the edge of the road, the solar flares from the sun run up the 
side of the wall and protrude about an inch from its surface. All of the wall 
around them is dark and only makes the brilliant yellow stand out all the more. 
Upon closer inspection, there appears to be a foot or hand sized chunk of the 
wall missing that has been painted back on the inside so its impossible to see 
from a distance greater than a foot and only believable when touched.

A Clean, Recently Renovated Building~
   This building is mostly empty, save for a few shelves that have been 
installed on the northern wall. From the heavy smell of paint and chemicals 
that linger here, it is quite safe to assume that this building has gone under 
recent renovation. The walls are pale grey in color and the dark, marble floor 
has been gently polished. A northern window sits between shelves, and like its

A Curved Section Of Ma Wai Walk~
   Reaching in from the northern side of the street are a couple brilliant 
yellow pointed tips on the walkway that stop and leave a gap of black duracrete 
squares before a tiny white planet appears. The surface has craters, the ones 
furthest from the yellow tips looking to be covered in ice. The duracrete 
pieces show no sign of wear and tear, appearing immaculately cared for. On the 
curve around to the east rides the tail end of a white streaking comet standing 
out against the black universe.

   If there were stars on the street then some of the pieces of the comets tail

pieces are all cut and placed so they look like tumbling pieces of white rock 
confined into a small specified space. Some of the cuts are recognizable as 
symbolizing rocks, but others look confusingly close to stars. The whole of 
the commet cannot be seen, only about a foot of the tail is visible on this

particular actually has a sculpture that looks humanoid with a top hat and 
wearing a three piece suit. Off on the very edge appears to be a biodome, but 
there isn't enough of it in view to tell if there is a civilization built up in 
it or not.

the surface. Inside the larger craters appears to be lined by ice and one in 
particular actually has a sculpture that looks humanoid with a top hat and 
wearing a three piece suit. Off on the very edge appears to be a biodome, but 
there isn't enough of it in view to tell if there is a civilization built up in 
it or not.

Ma Wai Walk, Outside The Hydroponics Building~
   Streaming in around the corner is a burning, white comet at the edge of the 
duracrete tiled street. The teraformed planet in the center of this section of 
the walkway appears to be out of the comets intended path. The surface of the 
planet is done in dark green with an opaque color that obscures the actual 
forms of the plantlife. A building to the east rises up just beyond the black 
universe, no longer part of the mural. On the wall below a window is a square 
planter with a short shrub growing inside that has shades of green and pink on 
the leaves.

   This comet streaks around the corner, debris falling in a line behind it and 
coming to be enveloped by a haze as it nears the main body that is about the 
size of a small town on one of the planets. The entire thing is surrounded by 
the haze as it blazes through space.

Hydroponics Bay~
   The smell of foliage is strong in the crisp air here. Long rows of green 
vegetables and herbs grow tightly together from long white tubes, each 
organized with their respective species and stacked to the grated ceiling 
above. The occasional ringing of footsteps can be heard with the sound of 
gently trickling water. While the scuffed, tan floor is littered with fresh 
and decaying plant matter, the bright, white walls that cover three sides and 
continue eastwards past the isles of greenery to a more open area. Along the 
northern wall is a metal grated staircase leading up to the ceiling above.

Hydroponic Arboretum~
   This large room is filled with assortments of trees growing in rows. The 
bases of these giants are emitting from long shallow water pools filled with 
small grey stones. The canopy overhead is dotted with flowers, fruits, and 
nuts, filling the room with natural hues and fragrances. The tan floor here is 
dotted with fallen fruit surrounded by the remains of pruned plant matter which 
only add to the bright white panels covering the walls and ceiling. To the 
west you can see packed isles of small plants growing together. There is a 
small indent in the floor in the southwest corner of the room next to a small

backdrop of tiny stars winking into existence. Duracrete shapes make up the 
stars that surround the blue and green planet in the middle of this section of

with a small smattering of buildings. Floating through space behind it is an

like a pathway in front of the southern door. Beside the door is a sign that

Ma Wai Walk High Speed Transit Tube Station~
   As the road stretches on it comes to a transit tube built into the wall. 
The duracrete street below is still covered in stars where the blackdrop can be 
seen, but right in the center there is the largest planet in the solar system. 
Ringed in different shades of brown and gas clouds it looks almost like a 
sedimentary rock except for the great red spot on its surface. Unlike the 
other planets, this one has dozens of moons orbiting it.

A Quiet Part Of Ma Wai Walk~
   The lessened traffic in this area lends to the quieting of this section of 
the road. Some sound still filters along the walkway from the western part of 
the road. The starry backdrop of the road wraps around the bend. Pinioned on 
the corner rests a large gaseous looking planet made out of rounded off pieces 
of colored duracrete. A wide ring symbolizes the thousands of rings around the 
planet and stretches around either corner of the curve in the street.

tools and small devices and along the western wall there are different sorts of 
equipment stored that don't fit with all the larger, advanced machines in the 
middle of the room. There is just about everything an electrician or mechanic 
would need held within this room. On display on the northern wall beside the 
window are a couple of art pieces made from old time mechanical parts.

around and welded in some places to hold it all together. Amusingly, there is 
a screw in the wall from which its leash handle is hung, leaving the dog 
dangling from its leash. 

Hung on the opposite side of the window is a cat with its wire tail curled 
around a screw in the wall. All the whiskers covering its face are done in 
strands of twisted wire attached to a conical head. A piston has been used as 
the body of the animal with metal tubing for the legs creating bends at the 
knees and feet at the bottom.

   While obviously being designed for storage there is plenty of space in here 
for several people to be comfortably surrounded by various shelves and lockers

   Not meant for huge audiences, this room is mediocre in size. The walls are 
done in a light creamy color with five different pictures of technology 
combined with mechanics placed along the walls. The levels of advancement 
increase starting from picture #6one#0 by the door and on around the room. Two

   A vision of the future, this robot is covered from head to toe in synthetics 
to make it look like human skin. The head is topped off with tousled brown 
hair. The lack of life in the blue eyes is the only giveaway that this is not 
a picture of a living human. The robot is dressed in a white button-up shirt, 
black dress slacks and a pair of black dress shoes. It stands with hands 
clasped in front of itself and blankly staring straight foreward as if awaiting 
command.

   Shiney titan metal has been carefully molded into the shape of a human head 
complete with a small tuft of short hair atop the head with eyes, nose, mouth 
and ears for the face. Permanently smiling, this android robot holds a perfect 
posture with a straight back and head held up high. The metal casing has been 
molded to look like the musculature of a mans body while being anatomically 
undefined in other places. The gears and mechanisms that make the robot are 
covered completely from from the head all the way down both arms and legs. 
~
E
three~
   Rounded and eggshaped are words the could describe the object that rests 
atop the gears and mechanisms that make up this robotic set of arms. The 
'head' does not contain any facial features or hair atop the head, but it is 
placed in the middle of the mechanical shoulders and attached with a few metal 
bars to hold it in place. Beneath a criss crossed open mesh of metal strips 
are all sorts of old earth fashioned gears, springs and wires that would make 
the arms attached to the shoulders work. A wooden tabletop runs across the 
picture just below the chest of the robot with a metal plate screwed into its 
surface to secure the robot in place.

   While no where near modern technology, this robot is slightly advanced. It 
has the original cylinder body with one portion of the cylindar that can turn 
and an attached camera on the moving part. Also attached to either side are a 
set of movable 'arms' with pinchers for hands. The treads have been upgraded 
to a trio of rotary wheels inside the tread that can flip to help climb small 
obstacles. Currently it is positioned with the arms held up as if in surrender 
and camera faced forward. 
~
E
one~
   Likely the oldest design of a robot, it has no arms and no face. It looks 
like a rickety cylinder with two wheeled tread for feet. The body is made with 
a metal that lacks any shine or special decoration like most protype robots. 
The 'robot' is facing at a slight angle, giving sight to the side of it that 
has a scrape on the casing as if it had fallen and been scratched.

A Deadly Quiet Section of Ma Wai Walk~
   The sounds of normal traffic have faded this far down the road, leaving it 
void of any normal background sound. Any noise made here would seem to echo 
off the walls of the surrounding buildings. Despite the lack of sound, the 
road mural continues with the intricate artwork. Atop the backdrop of dark, 
starry skies stands a light blue planet with a vertical equator, the opposite 
of any other planet thus far. There are at least ten moons circling the blue, 
landless planet.

   The road wanders along till it rounds off, ending with a sign that reads 
'Production Centre', positioned between the door and window of the building. A 
sea blue planet takes up most of the center of the road with a horizontal flow 
of colors to indicate the equator. A total of thirteen moons are positioned in 
various places around the planet, the largest of which rests like a foot mat in 
front of the door. It has delicate detail that shows a small volcano, erupting 
with a white substance.

starts at the hearth of the furnace and radiates out across the whole floor. 
The ceiling itself also has a motif on it made out of the little squares and 
triangles of duracrete. In the corner opposite the furnace is a workbench that 
spans the length of one wall with all sorts of tools of the trade that could 
come in handy. Not to mention, on the wall next to the bench are several 
machines that could be used in the making of several types of weapons and 
armor.

At The Top Of An Enormous Escalator~
   Through the vaulted roof of plexiglass panels, the sky bears down in a 
welcome escape from the barrage of visual marketing aids and special offers. 
Benches rest alongside the expansive window, allowing respite from the bustle. 
The view of the city peels away to the west, the shuttle bay partially visible 
with its regular stream of traffic that from here seems so much smaller. Great 
swathes of cloud hide the drop beneath but the industrious activity of 
hovercranes by the dozen lends something to the horizon. An #6escalator#0 
draws a stream of consumers up from the lower level, the geometric tiling 
guiding their path, while on another, the descending flow clutch their new 
purchases, moving in pairs down the broad conveyance. To the east behind the 
downward escalator is a turnstile with a universal sign for toilets 
holoprojected and turning slowly before it. To the west and to the south the

Upper Muhlifain Mall~
   The corridor is broad and clearly designed to allow large groups of people 
to pass through. The wall space of the shop that backs onto here is the canvas 
for infomercials about gym services, health advice, and nutrition. Opposite 
are the expansive plexiglass window tiles that look out over cloud banks 
masking the planet below, and in a westerly direction parts of Sky City. 
Geometric quartz patterns guide consumers down the central space toward the 
source of a range of piped music. The window display is taken up by the latest 
built-in amp hybrid guitars and hologram that appears to conduct the music 
playing at any given time.

A Busy Music Shop~
   A rolling series of musical soundbites continuously plays in the background, 
overlaid by a man's voice inviting consumers to be the next musical master or 
extolling the virtues of the various brands instore. The display is carved up 
amongst the instrumental categories, with brass neighbouring woodwind, 
electronic rubbing shoulders with synth. Glass cabinets protect much of the 
stock from the roaming hands of customers but the centre space is taken up by a 
majestic electronic grand piano. Toward the back of the shop a triple pedal 
drumkit has been set up with a holographic figure pretending to play. The 
figure changes gender and race occasionally, always looking very happy with the 
instrument.

A series of matte black hexagonal boxes are linked together by subtle hinges, allowing for the kit to be posed or shaped in a variety of configurations while seemingly composed of one solid piece. It's drum heads are electronically amplified with adjustable volumes, different tones, and even different instrument sounds. Cutting edge sensitivity technology means the kit need not even be struck. The holographic figure demonstrating it's use changes colours and represents different creeds and genders, pushing the idea that just about anybody can pick up and play.

An eclectic wash of colours grab at the eyes and demand attention of the 
people milling around inside. Novelty gifts, ornate pieces of pottery, 
personalised stuffed toys, and coloured gift boxes make up one section, while 
another wall is taken up by a whole array of different kinds of native fauna 
arranged into bouquets. Quaint video diaries in pastel colours are advertised 
by a tiny hologram panda that suggests recording memories of Venus to make

Southern Concourse~
   The way comes to an end here with shops either side, the patterned tiles 
forming a convergence of swirls decorated with seating and large plants 
spilling over with luscious plantlife. Pride of place facing the oncoming 
crowds is a holoprojection promoting Gaiman Corp. The company logo is followed 
by still shots of happy people, families, workers, and a vision of idyllic 
Venus. To the east behind floor to ceiling plexiglass window displays is a 
salon, the stylists within tending to a mix of male and female clients. To the 
west, a thousand ideas for a nice gift are offered up by a creative window 
display. A stuffed toy parrot perches amidst a mocked up jungle greenery with 
a host of other stuffed toys, while fashion jewellery spills out of a gift box 
designed like a treasure chest.

The Reception Of A Stylish Salon~
   Pleasant floral scents rush forth immediately upon entry, accompanied by the 
brisk current of warmth flowing from the rear of the salon. An S-shaped desk 
setup with the latest ranges of haircare products is set near the door. 
Seating is set up to either side where clientele await the ministrations of the 
stylists further toward the back of the room. A holoprojector runs short info 
clips about the latest styles, how to care for them, and what products are 
must-have as it hovers around the area.

   At the rear of the salon is a riot of noise and activity - chatter from the 
hair stylists and their customers compete with the drone of expensive hair 
beautification technology. New looks are moulded and discarded with 
disparitive ease to the backdrop of electro-pop that occasionally raises a 
singalong. Hair care tips are traded beside gossip with consumer suggestions 
gently tossed in for good measure.

Holoplex Maintenance~
   The hustle and bustle of the lobby above is almost inaudible down here. The 
ceiling and walls are cast out of a very solid, tile-textured durasteel, 
reinforced at even spacing with beams, for added support. The floor is plain 
duracrete with a treaded texture for assisted traction. The main content of 
this room appears to be vastly complex machinery, whirring and buzzing noisily 
as it performs all the tasks a holo-theatre would need, from data storage to 
projection status. To the east, a large double-door allows passage to a 
quietly humming room.

   This room is much smaller than the others, not much more than a cozy, 
circular nook. Still though, every inch has been packed with monitors hooked 
in to the walls, offering touch-screen controls. A series of buttons, switches 
and dials run along a console mounted below each monitor, giving a large 
variety of abilities to the use; Lighting control, temperature adjustment, 
doorlocks, escalator direction and more importantly, a panic button to secure 
the entire theatre in the event of a catastrophe.

door to the west, which offer passage only to those in possesion of proper 
clearance. The walls, ceiling and floor are all solid duracrete with thick 
polyprop siding to dampen the deafening hum of the machinery contained here. 
Massive, complex generators sit flush against the walls, peppered by glowing 
status lights and touchscreen interface control panels, giving off an eery glow 
that reflects from the adjacent machines. Occupying the center of the room is 
a series of monitors, displaying control options for the holotheatres 
themselves.

   Much the same as the entrance, this hallway implies a sense of grandness, 
though it's not as wide, or long. The floors are the same synthetic wood, 
interspaced with artistic motifs of classic tragedy/comedy masks, made of 
heavily polished synthmarble. The walls are lined with even more curtained 
holoposters for movies, blaring and fighting for your attention with their 
little displays for their respective films. The hall continues to the east 
through a wide archway, past more posters still. In the western wall, a series 
of #6escalators#0 carry citizens up from the lobby, or back down.

   Continuing down the hall, the lighting grows more and more dim. Curtains 
appear, hanging from the ceiling in long flows of elegent burgundy synthsilk. 
The synthwood floor turns in to lush polymesh carpeting, dyed an even shade of 
rich purple. Against the southern and northern wall, two #6escalators#0 lead 
to and from the second story seating for the theatre room, which resides behind 
a pair of red, tassled drapes, embroidered with twin comedy/tragedy masks 
respectively. Potted, genetically enriched flower plants line the hallway, 
rooted in multicolored hyrdoponic pebbles. Their leaves shimmer in a wide 
variety of unnnatural colors, drawing attention.

A Quiet, Dim Theatre~
   The theatre room is possibly the grandest of all rooms in the cinema, lit 
with dim chandeliers affixed to the high ceiling. The floor gently slopes 
downward as it nears the holostage, set with row after row of luxurious 
midnight blue synthleather seats. Massive, heavy curtains hide the stage when 
no production is in play. When there is one, they pull back seemingly of their 
own will to reveal the barren white-painted polycrete room, where the 
projections will appear. Above the western half of the room, an overhanging 
platform supports the top-tier audience.

A Wide Entryway, Before The Theatre~
   This room is wider than the hall below and fairly shorter. It appears to be 
a simple landing, #6escalators#0 against the southern and northern walls 
allowing access to it. A few rows of luxurious opera seats offer a place to 
settle, to watch the holostage to the east. Richly colored, red curtains hang 
between the room and the stage, embroidered with carefully detailed depictions 
of play scenes from long ago. The floor beneath the seats is more synthwood, 
mahogany by the looks. The rows leading around the seats are sloped gently, 
covered by soft turf green carpeting. At the front of this viewing platform, a 
synthwood plated durasteel rail prevents those of a clumsier nature from 
falling to the main floor of the theatre room.

made from tile-sectioned durasteel plates. Laser-etched in to the wall tiles 
are maps of various atomic structures, from caffiene to synthetic bonding 
agents. Between the structures of tin and aluminium, on the west wall, a large 
and durable polyprop door is marked as the exit. Farther south along the 
pristine floor there resides another similiar door, offering access to what a 
holosign declares to be "MAIN LABORATORY". A large holosign designed to 
resemble a DNA sequence proclaims "SciVa Laboratories - Where Science and 
Innovation meet!"

An Airy Stretch Of Hadar Way~
   The walls of the building to the west are made of panels of a smooth, 
polished kind of stone, not dissimilar colour from the fake marble slabs 
underfoot. A few windows made of a mirrored plexiglass are set into the front, 
along with a rectangular shaped planter that sits on the ground, housing a 
variety of lush, thick looking ferns mixed with bright green stalks that sprout 
huge carmine red flowers. To the south, the suspended walkway continues, 
another arm of the city visible far to the east while the backs of the 
buildings of Epsilon Centauri Island are visible northward.

short-cropped, maroon carpet leads the path from the door to the center of the 
large chamber where a circular, synthoak counter rests, bordering a towering 
machine that touches floor to ceiling. The various machines and shelves 
throughout the centre have been methodically arranged and there is a rather 
geometric feel to the floor plan of the chamber. Though people can be seen 
lounging and browsing through the equipment available here, the atmosphere is 
very quiet. Against the southern wall is a door and behind it is a staircase 
that leads up. Holotext hovers on the door, reading 'Overlook'. Lamps, 
diamond in shape, hang overhead and bathe the room in an even, comfortable 
light.

further north and the hiss and hum of the transit tubes drifting in from the

visible in a huge, arching curve from the north and right around to the south 
east. Synthetic marble makes up the slabs underfoot, and the dizzying drop to 
the south and east is cordoned off by the metal railings that are more

rail perfect for leaning on.

filter through, shelves with compartments built in front of them. Each 
compartment plays host to a different kind of container, bottles, tubes, tubs 
and packets all neatly lined up one after the other, some clever spring 
mechanism propelling the next container in line forward when one is removed so 
that the shelves always remain stocked. The walls are panels of moulded, white 
coated metal and a serving counter in the same style stands opposite the door. 
Everything is spotlessly clean, from the shelves and counter to the buffed, 
gleaming grey tiles.

   The metal railings here give way to the giant plexiglass surrounds of the 
transit tube system, the transport containers arriving and sliding seamlessly 
into them when summoned. People mill around and depart this area of the 
walkway in both directions, their footsteps audible on the imitation marble 
floor. Far to the east, the huge, towering structure of the Crux Centre can be 
made out, the transit tubes shuttling corporation employees endlessly between 
here, there and the various labs and other work places over on that side of the 
city.

   From the north where the walkway continues, the noise of the high speed 
transit tubes is clearly audible although it shifts in volume as the wind 
changes. With it in the right direction and at certain times, strains of music 
can be made out from Epsilon Centauri Island, although that section of the sky 
city is out of sight from this angle, just the backs of the buildings around 
its southern curve visible. To the west, the start of a neat, manicured 
looking garden can be seen, the fishtail tiles of the path that leads through 
it matching those of the walls of the building to the south, which boasts two 
large windows to either side of a wide door.

   The synthetic marble slabs end in a sharp, neat line, separated from the 
neatly manicured, bio-engineered grass band of gold hued metal. A gently 
winding path leads through the grass to the south, made of tiny rectangular 
tiles arranged in a fishtail pattern, while trees and plants grow in raised 
circular beds, each one filled with hydroponic pebbles, mostly black and grey 
but with the occasional bead of gold. The path also leads to the door of a 
tall, windowless building that stands to the north.

rectangular blocks, each with a small set of frosted plexiglass doors that open 
out onto a catwalk. There are hundreds of these capsules stacked neatly on top 
of each other, a white-painted metal staircase behind the desk providing access

water ripples within, trickling down from the sculpture in the centre of a 
massive, spire shaped ship caught in flight and suspended by a spirals of 
metal, punched with stars. A series of saplings line the path, tall and

   The building to the west seems to be the last part of this arm of the city 
and southwards, only the vast expanse of open sky is visible for miles and 
miles, rolling hills of clouds stretching out as far as the eye can see. The 
path leads up to the double doors of an impressive, tall building that climbs

blocks. The gardens continue right up to the beds that sit beneath the ground

The Rigel Kent Apartments Lobby~
   Double doors to the east lead into a large, rectangular room that stretches 
out from here and further south. Tiles cover the floor, white with a grey 
marble effect but for a narrow border of black a little way in from the edge of 
the room, dipping in to follow the lines of a couple of alcoves set into the 
walls. Fluted plinths stand in the alcoves, stone busts of famous figures in 
Lunar history settled upon them, each one illuminated by hidden lighting.

   In the corner of this room is a large, frosted glass tube with double doors, 
an elevator beyond providing access to the various apartments on the floors 
above. The white walls are hung with pictures in silver frames, all showing 
scenes of the megacities on the Moon and the tiles on the floor are white, 
marbled with grey. A large, round metal desk occupies a space in the centre of 
the floor, a series of screens above it showing the current rental prices for 
apartments in this building.

Rigel Kent Apartments Storage~
   All the available wall space in this room is lined with wide shelves that 
stretch from the polycrete floor right up to the white panel clad ceiling, only 
broken by the door. They are modular, fitted some kind of moving railing 
system that allows them to be raised or lowered to create suitable space for 
storing even large items of furniture. It is a large space, but the towering 
shelving makes it feel rather claustrophobic.

   The sound of machinery and running water is deafening. The room is

movement difficult. The fist two of a trifecta of massive pipes branch from 
the top of the pump and run perpendicular to each other at the eastern and 
western sides of the room. The third runs straight with the floor towards the

A Hidden Space Beneath The Holostage~
   Not really tall enough to stand fully upright in, this space is nestled 
under the holostage. The floor is unfinished polycrete, rough and left bare, 
the stage surface resting on a platform held up by a number of pillars, 
supports and metal struts, a ventilation grill in the front providing access to 
the theatre beyond it. Wires and cabling trails all over the place, pinned and 
fixed somewhat haphazardly, disappearing into holes and pipes. Dust collects 
here, especially in the corners and the gentle hum of machinery and electronics 
can be heard.

The Agena Overlook~
   In much the same manner as the ground floor, the overlook has been dressed 
with fine, marble flooring and vibrant, lively plants. Save for the southern 
wall where the stairs descend until they meet the door at the foot of the 
staircase, the walls are made of clear plexiglass that expose the city and 
Venusian sky beyond this room. The furniture has been arranged in the center 
of the overlook and it seems very likely this space is used for private 
learning or conferences. Diamond-shaped lamps hang overhead and bathe the room 
in an even, comfortable light.

Ventilation Access~
   This small room is dim with light grey walls. The hard, unfinished floor 
leads to a large piece of machinery in the middle. Two square metal tubes 
reach from the sides of the floor, reaching the apex that is a machine in the 
middle. The machine itself emits a constant hum from the rectangular middle, 
leading to a cylindrical tube to the room underfoot.

A Temporary Office Structure~
   This small, rectangular building is clearly just a temporary structure and 
not intended for long term use. Flimsy walls of grey corrugated plastic do 
little to keep the noise from outside from filtering through and the polyvinyl 
covered floor shakes and vibrates with every footfall, almost adding the hint 
of a bounce to each step. Despite this, the temperature seems to be regulated 
and it's functional, if rather utilitarian.

At The Bottom Of A Narrow Ladder~
   A narrow ladder from a hatch above leads into space with a fairly high 
ceiling that is unfinished, various wires and cables exposed, strapped into 
place in metal frames although no panels have been slotted in to cover them 
yet. The northern wall looks solid enough despite being in a similar state, 
also left free of panels, while the western wall is covered over and houses a 
metal door hung on heavy hinges. The floors is a level, smooth polyresin in a 
very dark grey and the lights are just simple strips, presumably hooked into 
the main system as there doesn't appear to be a switch to operate them.

A Makeshift Basement Bar~
   Despite the smooth polyresin of the floor, this room has an unfinished kind 
of feel to it. The walls are covered in plain white metal panels, but several 
are missing and the wiring beyond is visible, tightly tied bundles of cable 
ranging in thickness to thick, almost arm width wires. A series of shelves 
have been built from metal girders that span the whole of the western wall and 
a bar has been constructed in front of that, the base made from duraslate 
paving slabs cemented together while the top looks like a couple of repurposed 
wall panels. A row of stools sit in front of the bar and a few of mismatched 
sets of tables and chairs are scattered about.

The Back Room Of A Basement Bar~
   Not really a separate room, this area of the basement nonetheless feels 
apart from the rest due to a supporting archway of metal beams that shores up 
the ceiling and whatever is above. More panels are missing here, wires and 
cables visible in places, a few of them pulled out and pinned into new 
positions. It looks like this space was originally intended to be some kind of 
storage area, brackets mounted on the wall although no shelves are fixed to 
them. Instead, a number of tables have been pushed back against the walls. 
East, an unmarked door stands, clad in textured metal.

A Somewhat Grimy Washroom~
   This facility is pretty basic, just a small, square room with bare polycrete 
floors and unfinished walls, a single, lonely looking metal sink and dryer unit 
mounted into the wall opposite the northern door. A rather brash light is 
provided courtesy of a single strip light fixed to the ceiling, this room 
entirely free of any niceties beyond the absolute basics.

A Cramped Toilet Stall~
   Probably just large enough to fit two in desperate and possibly slightly 
unusual circumstances, this toilet stall is not all that pleasant. An odour of 
stale urine seems to invade and the polycrete floor around the base of the 
metal toilet itself is rather stained. Dusty footprints mark the floor and the 
door is smudged with fingerprints, but this place obviously gets cleaned at 
least every now and then and isn't entirely disgusting.

The Interior of a Cramped Sleeping Capsule~
   This confined space is just large enough to hold a single person comfortably 
upon the spartan mattress that dominates the interior. A few pouches line the 
door, and there's room enough for a bag or two in the narrow gap between it and 
the bed. A small console is set in the wall, allowing the lights and 
temperature to be controlled within a narrow range.

The Bottom Of A Wide Staircase~
   The wide staircase against the western room opens up to this area, which is 
surprisingly spacious for a hallway. The floor is covered with large 
polyrubber tiles, a slight texture worked into the surface to make them 
non-slip. The corridor itself doesn't extend far, meeting doors to the north 
and south as well as another to the east. Light emanates from a series of 
triangular metal sconces on the wall, each with three horizontal lines cut 
neatly in the front. There is a faintly chemical scent lingering and an oddly 
dead quality to the sound that filters through from surrounding rooms.

A Small Foyer~
   Separated from the outside world by a thin polyprop door, this cozy front 
room is dully illuminated by a ceiling lamp. Rather spartan, and utterly 
lacking in adornment, off-white polyprop walls encase the room, with the 
exception of a slender doorway, curtained off with a sheet of cloth. Scuffed 
flooring marks the shifting of past furnishings, whilst a mechanical hum 
occasionally reaches through the walls.

A Roomy Changing Area~
   A row of opaque glass stalls cover one entire wall of this room, while a 
series of silver metal lockers occupy the one opposite, each one fitted with a 
thumb scanner. In the centre of the room, a long, double sided, grey polyprop 
bench splits the space in half, ergonomically moulded and drilled with a series 
of tiny holes, probably to allow any collected water to drain through. The 
walls are painted a bright, glossy white while the rubber tiled floor is a dark 
grey, flecked with silver.

A Blue Tiled Wet Room~
   Small, very dark blue tiles cover the floor, walls and ceiling of this 
rounded room. A metal shower head protrudes from one wall, a touch screen 
panel inset beneath to operate it although it has no surround or curtain, 
turning this whole area into a wet room. A metal toilet is set into the wall, 
the outside of the bowl also tiled in blue while the cistern is recessed and 
hidden away, a matching metal sink also emerging from a tiled curve in the 
wall. The whole of the ceiling is a piece of opaque, smoked glass with lights 
set behind it, providing a soft, noninvasive glow.

An Echoey Space Before A Pool~
   Textured pale green tiles cover the floor of this space, neatly grouted. A 
row of darker green tiles mark a border at the edge of a drop filled with 
water, accessible via a gleaming metal ladder set to one side, or simply by 
stepping in. The walls are also slightly tinted with green, a wavy line of 
perfectly flat lights set around waist level around the whole room, providing 
illumination in addition to a big glass globe suspended from the ceiling. 
Sound echoes in here, bouncing off the hard surfaces and there's a faintly 
chemical scent that sometimes wafts through, detectable just for a moment 
before it disappears.

The Shallow End Of A Swimming Pool~
   Overhead, the roof is slightly domed, painted a pale shade of green with a 
series of diamond shaped lights set into the curve in a complicated, geometric 
pattern. The water is heated but still pleasantly cool and salty to the taste, 
shallow here but getting deeper as the tiles slope away to the north. Lights 
glow softly underwater, enclosed in bubbles of frosted glass spaced at regular 
intervals along the sides of the pool.

The Deep End Of A Swimming Pool~
   After a gentle slope, the tiled floor drops away sharply and the water is 
suddenly too deep to stand up in. The domed roof with its diamond shaped 
lights stretches overhead, the edges of the pool pushed right up against the 
edges of the wall, which provide no purchase although the way out is visible 
further to the south via a metal ladder.

   Entirely underwater, this is the deep end of a swimming pool with floor and 
sides made of pale green tiles. There are a few lights set into the corners 
down here, just little strips that lead the way further westward, to some kind 
of underwater tunnel.

   The tunnel from east is short, hardly a tunnel at all. The tiled walls here 
are round and the tunnel continues upwards, the water seeming to break just 
overhead where another domed ceiling is visible, the lights blurry through the 
water.

   A low, domed ceiling arches over this circular pool, which seems to have 
little real purpose. There are diamond shaped lights in the ceiling, arranged 
in a complicated pattern and a wavy line of dark green lights that break up the 
paler green walls, but there is no way out from the salty water here.

A Spacious Gym With A Sprung Floor~
   The material covering the floor of this area has a definite bounce to it, a 
kind of poured polyrubber that absorbs the shock of impact. It is a uniform 
red, matching the stripe painted around the centre of the otherwise white wall 
and broken only by the black outlines of several circles of varying sizes. 
This area is wide enough to function as a training area for several combatants, 
while racks on the wall provide places to hang equipment.

   The entire western half of this space is lined with a thick, padded kind of 
cushioning in a soft but rubbery material, perfect for practicing falls. Other 
than that, it is entirely unremarkable, the walls just the same white as the 
rest of the gym, the red stripe continuing at around waist height while strip 
lights provide illumination from above.

Six walls of organic gadgetry comprise this cage. They flicker with self-illuminated rainbows of neon, pulsing down fiber optics and flashing free from silent klaxons. Only the sound of buzzing and beating calls challenge to the silence. A gigantic RAM chip to the east has been carved from a Kraken's femur.

A Spacious Boarding Bay~
   Sweeping and metallic married with polyprop, this space has a pair of 
hydraulic doors that would open up to portside. There are rows designated for 
cargo, for a neat lines of incoming colonists, for the removal of baggage. 
When not docking, the lights are white. However during docking procedures, the 
currently dull red warning lights come alive. There's a small tread to the 
room, adding a touch more grip for the crowds that stream in and out.

perhaps salvaged from somewhere else. The space is a decent size and a frosted 
plexiglass panel to one side allows light in from outside. The walls are 
unpainted, clearly showing the mismatched metal and polyprop sheets from which 
the building is constructed.

A Draughty, Utilitarian Bathroom~
   Draughts whisper in through the cracks in the metal and polyprop walls of 
this bathroom and the floor, covered with thick, textured chrion tiles, seems 
slightly uneven and creaks ever so slightly underfoot. Stalls with flimsy 
looking doors line the northern and wall and a long metal trough runs almost 
the full length of the room from east to west, providing space for a decent 
number of people to wash at once. The trough is split in half with taps on 
either side and a series of small strips of mirror are mounted on metal frames 
at around eye level, a few cracked although most remain intact. A bench lines 
the southern wall and further east, a flimsy looking door separates the shower 
area.

   Built into the upper level of the arched hangar, this bunk room is large and 
fairly spacious, occupying roughly two thirds of the width of the whole 
building. It's far from cosy, draughts creeping in through the mismatched 
panels of metal and polyprop that make up the walls and ceiling, the sounds 
from outside sometimes filtering through. The end wall to the east has been 
liberally coated in red paint, now flaking and peeling and underfoot, textured 
chrion panels have been laid to cover the floor.
