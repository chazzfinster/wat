Northeastern Corner Of A Camp~
   A series of scrubby looking bushes grow against the cliff face that rises up 
to the north and continues to curl around to the east, leaving this area mostly 
sheltered from the surroundings. The rest of the vegetation seems to have been 
mainly cleared, just a stubble of tree stumps visible where they escape the 
dark brown soil, not even as wide as a hand. High above, a series of metal 
hooks have been fixed into the rock and a few cables string out further into 
the camp.

By A Sloping Grey Cliff~
   Cliffs surround this area, the dark grey stone weathered with moss nestled 
in the many cracks and crevices while a mass of thriving ferns grow at the base 
of it. Westward, the cliffs are extremely steep although the incline is less 
aggressive to the north, more a staggered series of large but solid looking 
boulders. The rest of the camp stretches out around, a number of prefab 
container buildings standing in stark contrast to the lush green of the 
rainforest that is clearly visible further south.

A Cleared Area in A Camp~
   This area is almost at the centre of a large clearing surrounded on all 
sides but the south by towering grey basalt rock that curl around it, seemingly 
the base of some impressive looking mountains. The peaks aren't visible from 
here, the clearing seemingly nestled into some kind of enormous crag. The 
vegetation has been cleared, although scraggly grass grows up stubbornly 
through the rich brown Venusian soil that has been considerably churned up 
underfoot.

In The Midst Of A Rainforest Camp~
   Open to the sky, this area is exposed and offers little protection from the 
sky although the surrounding mountains offer at least some degree of shelter 
from the wind. It has been cleared of trees and bushes although grass is 
attempting to grow through recently turned over soil, a vibrant green in 
colour. Overhead, high tensile cables have been strung and lengths of wire 
dangle like thin snakes, the subject of much interest to a number of brightly 
coloured birds who occasionally alight to investigate.

Eastern Corner Of A Camp~
   The soil underfoot here has been overturned, roughly dug out to remove the 
roots of fallen trees and bushes and scrubby grass and moss has started to grow 
unevenly, torn apart by the passage of feet. Eastward, an almost sheer looking 
mass of grey basalt climbs high into the sky, jutting out in a craggy overhang 
well above head height that provides this area with a little shelter from the 
otherwise open sky.

By A Sheer Cliff Face~
   To the west, the basalt cliffs rise steeply upwards, speckled with moss. 
Far overhead the steepness seems to subside, perhaps resulting in some kind of 
a ledge for the branches of bushes, heavy with leaves can be made out. 
Underfoot, the jungle floor has been cleared of all large vegetation although a 
few bushes and ferns still remain close to the base of the rocks. High tensile 
cables are strung overhead, fixed to the rocks but well out of reach, trailing 
loops of wire in places.

A Cleared Area Of Rainforest~
   This area is surrounded by the rest of the camp, the ground cleared of trees 
and roots but still rough and uneven, the thick Venusian soil moist and clumped 
into a rich red mud where areas of high traffic form paths. Outside of those 
paths, grass is making an attempt to grow although it is trampled and squished 
into the dirt, a somewhat sorry sight in comparison to the veil of lush green 
that is visible some distance to the south.

Near The Centre Of A Rainforest Camp~
   Grass grows here, the blades thick and very green although the cover is 
sparse, growth stunted by the passage of feet. The ground has been churned 
into a rich red mud, rough and uneven but generally free from vegetation. All 
around is the camp, the towering shapes of mountains visible in all directions 
except for the south, where the wild looking rainforest is visible past the 
boundaries of this small cleared area.

and heavily textured with leafy green plants and ferns growing on numerous, 
naturally formed ledges. Much further south, the jungle threatens, a looming 
curtain of dense and impenetrable looking green.

The Boundary Of A Rainforest Camp~
   The basalt cliffs to the west continue just a little way past a flimsy 
looking chain link fence a bit taller than the average person. A couple of 
metal hooks have been drilled into the rock to anchor it in place, but it 
doesn't look especially sturdy and provides a clear view to the rainforest 
beyond, which presses right up against it. Branches poke through in several 
places and the calls of animals and birds can be easily heard, along with the 
chirrup of insects but the undergrowth looks wild and untamed beyond the 
confines of the fence, this cleared area seeming positively groomed by 
comparison.

By A Fence On The Edge Of A Camp~
   All along the southern stretch of this area is a tall chain link fence 
panel, following a not quite straight line between two trees. Bolted directly 
into the trunks, it allows a clear view of the jungle beyond although vision is 
restricted somewhat by the sheer number of trees and bushes that grow close 
together, a mass of vibrant greens and browns strewn with brightly coloured 
flowers. In all other directions, the cleared area that makes this camp 
stretches out, housing a few prefab container buildings mounted on scrubby 
grass.

A Chain Link Gate Before A Rainforest~
   The chain link fence panels are broken here by a gate suspended between 
metal poles. The ground is utterly devoid of grass or any other vegetation in 
a path that leads straight to the gate, continuing further east to a large, 
round duracrete block and then north and west to the rest of the camp. Past 
the gate stands the Venusian rainforest in all its tropical glory, a thousand 
shades of green marked with flashes of colour where flowers bloom and brightly 
hued birds streak past.

A Shuttle Landing Area In A Rainforest Clearing~
   Set a safe distance from the craggy, uneven surface of the basalt cliffs to 
the east is an enormous round block. Built of duracrete, it has some a shock 
absorbent, textured black polyresin surface inlaid with the huge gold 'GC' that 
makes up the Gaiman Corp logo. It is easily large enough to offer a secure 
landing area to a small shuttle and three wide steps and a ramp provide access 
to the rich, red brown of the Venusian earth. A chain link fence blocks of 
access to the south where a thicket of lush green, tropical trees and plants 
grow into a vast, dense tangle.

The Edge Of A Rainforest~
   The trees and bushes and tangled undergrowth creep right up to the edges of 
the craggy rock face that extends upwards to the west, too steep to climb 
although its ledges are crowded and heavy with greenery. One plant in 
particular boasts a glorious spray of trumpet shaped flowers in a vibrant 
purple that seem to almost drip down from it, maybe just in reach at a stretch. 
The rainforest ends abruptly, pressed right up against a chain link fence 
beyond which seems to be an area that's mainly free from trees, dotted with 
prefab container buildings sunk into the red hued mud.

A Small Clearing In Front Of A Gate~
   A space has been carved out of the rainforest here, the ragged, sawn off 
trunks of trees oozing sap and revealing concentric rings within the splintered 
cases of textured bark. A rough semicircle has been cleared, leaving the chain 
link gate to the north easily accessible but on all other sides, the trees 
continue to creep in, a wild tangle of trunks and branches and trailing 
creepers. The ground has been churned up and flattened out into something 
approaching a path of moist, squelchy red mud that continues on through the 
gate but disappears under a blanket of moss, ferns and fallen leaves in all 
other directions.

Near A Chain Link Fence In The Rainforest~
   Some attempt has been made at clearing the trees here although it hasn't 
been entirely successful and the trees and bushes still encroach, branches 
stretching up like groping hands against the chain link fence which actually 
seems to be strung between two thick trunks. There is a small area of ground 
just to this side of the fence where the muddied ground is visible, the growth 
of grass and other low level plants pushed back somewhat.

Outside A Camp In The Rainforest~
   A chain link fence has been strung from basalt cliffs that rise up to the 
northwest and the trunk of a tree further east, tall but not obscuring the view 
of the clearing beyond. The space within the fence boasts several prefab 
container buildings and little in the way of vegetation. The same can't be 
said for this area, although a path of sorts has been cleared close to the 
fence. Southwards, the undergrowth is wild, a mix of tall trees, smaller 
tropical plants with exotic looking flowers and leafy looking ferns that sprout 
up from the moss covered floor.

At The Base Of A Basalt Cliff~
   A cliff of dark grey basalt rises abruptly to the north, very steep but with 
angular ledges that serve as platforms for the plants that grow there. From 
one such ledge tumbles an enormous tangle of creepers, some long dead and woody 
looking, others clearly newer growth, all long tendrils of fleshy green. In 
the other directions, the rainforest looms, mysterious and inviting, punctuated 
frequently by the calls of birds and the rustling of leaves.

At The Bottom Of A Gentle Incline~
   The ground here slopes gently upwards towards the west where the trees seem 
thinner, the continuing dark shape of the mountains and cliffs bending around 
to the northwest. A spur of rock juts out here in an angular arm at around 
waist height, its rough and uneven surface free from plants, although a gaggle 
of leafy ferns nestle around its base and a number of saplings sprout up from 
the ground, a disorganised mess of species judging by the number of different 
leaf shapes and shades.

A Gentle Slope Near A Cliff Face~
   A scatter of loose basalt rocks lie piled up against the cliff that juts up 
out of the ground to the east, forming a kind of rockery where a number of 
small, fleshy plants are loosely rooted. As the rocks peter out, the ground 
gives way to crumbly soil of a deep, rich brown with a red hue to it, strewn 
with scree and other natural debris from the surrounding mountains. There are 
trees here but they're fairly thinly spread and lack the substance of the trees 
deeper into the rainforest.

A Sheltered Corner Near A Cliff~
   A slight overhang in the cliffs to the north leaves this quiet corner of 
sparsely vegetated rainforest sheltered. To the east, the angular basalt rocks 
that make up the start of a mountain are less steep, almost forming a series of 
enormous steps. The rest of the area is taken over by trees, mostly fairly 
young, judging by their slender trunks and meagre crowns. The colours though 
are anything but small, vivid and vibrant and sometimes startling bright 
flowers blooming all around.

A Rocky Corner Of Thin Rainforest~
   Bushes sprout up from the ground, very green against the dark grey of the 
rocks that cup around this area, blocking off the way north and snaking around 
to the west, where they seem to continue. The ground is uneven, dotted with 
grasses and spongy with moss that grows on the trunks of the trees, most of 
which are small and springy looking with slim profiles, some boasting delicate 
flowers while others have broad, wide leafs dappled with reds and a few have a 
blueish tinge to the bark.

   The cliffs to the north are still visible through the thin trees here, 
providing a backdrop against which their silvery hued trunks and the callow, 
sometimes fragile angles of their branches are framed. Low lying plants and 
flowers grow at the bases of the trees, the canopy here not thick enough to 
block out the light and although the growth here is relatively young, it seems 
to be thriving.

   Mountains climb up into the cloud-filled sky to the north, seeming to

cliff, presumably not so able to gain purchase in the scattered, jumbled 
angular rocks that lie at the base of it. Mosses and ferns have taken over 
instead, growing in the cracks and crevices that also provide home to a number 
of insects and possibly small lizards and mammals, glimpses of motion 
frequently visible.

the sides of many, creepers climb around others, trailing from branches like 
curtains. It is very quiet but for the murmur of insects, the rustle of 
leaves, both the dead and fallen ones on the ground and those still living, a 
hundred different shades of green.

   The view eastward through sparse trees here is beautiful, deeper and denser 
rain forest visible further in that direction as the ground slopes gently

substantial enough to full shade the area from the sky so whatever light there 
is always dappled and uneven, shifting as the breeze stirs the branches into 
motion.

On The Edge Of A Sharp Drop~
   The trees thin out to nothing here and then the ground just stops. Over the 
edge to the west is a dizzying drop that plunges violently down and then far, 
far below, the canopy of the Venusian rainforest visible stretches out for 
miles like a verdant blanket occasionally broken by a ribbon of blue where a 
river cuts through the landscape. From up this high up, the wide curve of an 
enormous round crater shape can be made out far to the south, the profile of an 
almost terrifyingly large mountain range occupies the space to the north and 
very far to the west there's a glint that could be the ocean or perhaps just a 
trick of the light.

   From here, the view of the Venusian rainforest is clearly visible to the

drops away, making passage that way impossible. It seems fairly stable, the 
dirt underfoot ending a little way and revealing the dark grey of basalt, this 
area presumably formed by some kind of volcanic activity. Indeed, the 
mountains to the north can be glimpsed easily through the trees and seem to be 
entirely formed of the same rock, scattered with greenery and vegetation and 
rising steadfastly into a range of peaks.

Near An Enormous Fallen Tree~
   A tree right on the western edge of this area lies almost parallel with the 
rainforest floor, seemingly uprooted and toppled over, providing a barrier to 
the rainforest further to the south. It's enormous, the trunk thick with 
gnarled, greyish brown bark, the branches sticking out at odd angles, still 
boasting green leaves with some areas of new growth. Other plants have made 
their homes in it, bushes sprouting in the nooks and crannies that its branches 
have created so that its hard to tell where the tree ends and the rest of the 
vegetation begins.

   West of here, the ground slopes upwards. It's a gentle slope, a slow 
incline where the growth of trees and bushes seems to be relatively sparse, 
allowing a decent view of what seems to be a clearing opening up to the west 
and the dark shape of cliffs or mountains visible northwards. The branches 
overhead play games with the shade, throwing it in pools that seem to shift 
with the light, leaving this area dappled and beautiful.

A Light Area Of Rainforest~
   While there are trees everywhere, they seem to be rooted fairly far apart, a 
few huge specimens here that climb high into the sky before their branches 
shoot outwards. Bushes grow in clumps, especially around the bases of the 
trees but the ground is clearly visible in places, coated with dead leaves and 
broken twigs, along with plants that push their way up through the jungle 
litter. This means progress is relatively easy here, if somewhat damp due to 
the moisture in the air.

   Trees grow lightly here, passage not too hard as the lower lying vegetation 
tends to cluster around the widely spaced trunks. There are areas where 
progress is more difficult, especially where the bushes sprout thorns, some of 
them rather vicious looking although many of the more dangerous looking plants 
also boast exotic and beautiful looking flowers in a range of colours, 
everything from pure and striking white to vibrant crimsons and sunny yellows.

Among Treestumps And Light Underbrush~
A section of the forest has been partially cleared, leaving the knee-height 
stumps of felled trees amidst the sparse underbrush. All around, the jungle 
begins in earnest, stretching southward in a sea of greens and browns. A wide 
range of vegetation thrives in the area, from majestic trees to dense, tangled 
bushes and drooping vines. From all sides, the strange sounds of unseen 
wildlife pulses and bickers in a constant symphony of chirps, croaks, clicks 
and buzzes. The forest is extremely damp and humid, soaking any traveller in 
no time.

A Stretch Of Light Rainforest~
   Grass turns to sparse underbrush, and underbrush turns to light forestation. 
The rainforest stretches out around, a mixture of trees and bushes, low lying 
plants that sprout up. The ground is carpeted with dead leaves and broken 
twigs in various states of decay, the smell of them organic and earthy and 
swamp, strong in places but not really unpleasant.

Up Against A Basalt Cliff~
   The basalt cliff that pushes up out of the dirt to the east towers far 
overhead, a large section jutting out and blocking passage south. Ferns grow 
right up against it, some startling green, some more silvery in colour and a 
tree with broad leaves grows close to the rocks, its gnarled and knotted roots 
partially exposed and twisted into hazardous loops just the right size to catch 
a foot and turn an ankle.

A Sheltered Corner By A Cliff~
   The section of rock that juts protrudes from the eastern rock face entirely 
blocks off the way to the north, making almost a corner. The plants are wild 
and overgrown, the trunks of the trees heavy with lichen, delicately frilled 
folds of silvery grey that entirely obscure the bark in some places. The 
canopy is thinner here, the sky visible where the dark grey basalt cliff 
prevents the trees from growing too close, sections of it framed by branches.

In A Thick Area Of Jungle~
   To the north, the rainforest opens up a little but in the other directions 
it continues to sprawl out. The sounds of life are constant, a mixture of bird 
and animal calls punctuated by the buzz of insects and the beating of winds. 
Water drips too where the moisture in the air collects on glossy green leaves 
and beads in the fronds of ferns.

A Thick, Wild Area Of Jungle~
   Dense vegetation grows all around, frequently stirred into motion by things 
that rustle. Birds chirrup to each other, insects buzz through the air in 
flashes of metallic, jewel shades and flowers bloom. Progress is tricky, the 
ground a mass of exposed roots and trailing vines that are quick to catch a 
foot and send any explorers sprawling to the jungle floor.

Somewhere In The Humid Rainforest~
   Creepers trail lazily from the branches of trees, along with glistening 
cobwebs. The moisture collects in droplets along the silk strands, outlining 
the beautiful spiral patterns of them, their creators sometimes visible, 
working busily to repair shreds and tears. In every direction, the rainforest 
continues, sprawling out as far as the eye can see, which is sometimes not far 
at all where the trees grow more closely together.

A Dripping, Humid Area Of Rainforest~
   The humidity is especially bad here, the branches of the trees overhead 
growing tightly together so that there is next to no sky visible at all. As 
well as reducing the light, it traps the air which is heavy with moisture and 
seems to stick to the skin. Water gathers on the branches of vegetation too, 
dripping wetly from the tips of branches, glistening on nearly invisible 
cobwebs spun between gaps in the trees.

Somewhere In A Moist Rainforest~
   All around, trees grow. Some of them grow straight up before exploding into 
glorious crowns of green leaves, others sprout lower, ladder-like limbs. 
Bushes flourish here too, water dripping from the tips of flower laden branches 
and things stir frequently in the undergrowth and flashes of bright colour are 
occasionally visible as feathered wings beat the air in a flurry as small 
clusters of birds wind their way between the trees.

By A Fallen Tree In A Rainforest~
   Lying almost flat against the rainforest floor is a fallen tree, vast in 
side with its extensive and exposed root system barring the way west and its 
massive trunk blocking the way north. Plants and bushes have grown up all 
around it, adding to the existing growth that graces the branches so that it 
still seems very much alive and thriving despite its fallen state.

Fungal Colony~
   Dense clusters of fungus carpet the area, thriving on older trees that have 
fallen. Their bright speckly colour scheme is decorative as they climb like 
clams around the thick dead wood. Healthier trees stand the test of time, 
their corded trunks twisting like a ladies skirt afford nesting opportunities 
beneath their powerful roots. The fungus colony teems with a rich insect 
community that serves to feed the smaller land going mammals, a staple pillar 
in the cycle of rich jungle ecology.

A Musty Area Of Rainforest~
   A few old trees have fallen here, their massive root systems sticking up 
into the air like great walls, hollows beneath them where the earth has been 
torn up and clings to the snaky tendrils in clumps. There's a musty feel here, 
mould and fungus creeping into this area from the west, the blanket of bright 
colour blending into the lush greens and soft browns of the surrounding jungle.

   In every direction here, the rainforest stretches out, a rich tapestry of 
greens and browns with splashes of colour woven in. Things stir, mostly unseen 
but for the sudden movement of a springy branch, caught and made to dance for a 
moment, usually causing a shower of sparkling droplets to splatter out in all 
directions. It's damp here, the humidity clinging, the air seeming almost 
soupy in places.

Through A Natural Arch~
   The untamed vegetation forms a natural arch where two thick branches from 
adjacent trees have grown towards and past each other. Vines twist around the 
branches and hang down like an irregular veil, draped in lazy coils and gentle 
curves across the rainforest's lower and middle tiers. The jungle continues in 
all directions, humid and oppressive, its perpetually wet vegetation dripping 
with water and brimming with unseen life.

Dense, Funnel-Leafed Underbrush~
   Thick underbrush takes hold here, consisting primarily of bushes with 
funnel-shaped leaves. Clinging to every tree and suspending themselves between 
the trunks, they are matte green on the outside and silver on the inside where 
the texture of the leaves is almost velvety. The bushes they grow upon are 
tough and flexible, springing back into place if pushed aside. Few paths are 
available through the vegetation, giving the area a claustrophobic quality and 
poor visibility.

By An Enormous, Lichen-Covered Tree~
   The thick, untamed jungle briefly opens up in a small clearing here, 
deferring to a gigantic tree that looms majestically over the rest of the 
verdant canopy. Many feet in diameter, the trunk bulges like some overly 
muscular arm that rises from the jungle floor. The vertically rippled trunk 
flares out near the ground where thick, gnarled roots bore into the moist soil. 
The wood itself is a dull brown color, but much of the bark is covered with 
large patches silvery lichen like the continents of a map. Far above, great 
branches extend with their flora of glossy green leaves.

Somewhere In The Rainforest~
   The rush of falling water is audible from the south, the glint of it perhaps 
visible through the thicket of undergrowth that sprouts up from the ground. 
Cliffs stand to the east, the rocks a very dark grey and angular, heavily 
spotted with moss and lichen that clings to them stubbornly and seems to thrive 
in the many nooks and crannies. Trees grow all around, not too tightly packed 
although bushes, ferns and shrubs sprout between them meaning that little of 
the leaf-blanketed ground is clear.

At The Edge Of A Pool Of Water~
   The ground slopes down eastward from here towards the base of some cliffs, 
forming a pool into which a waterfall cascades from far above, churning the 
water white although it has stilled somewhat by the time it reaches the edge 
here. The surrounding rocks are wet, slick with moss and plants grow lushly 
around the rim of the pool, the earth closer to it turned to a thick, moist 
mud. The rush of the falling water is constant and fairly loud, broken 
sometimes by the sharp cry of a bird or other, harder to identify noises.

In The Thick Of The Jungle~
   The jungle grows dense here. The wild and perpetually moist vegetation 
forms an almost impassable barrier, scratching any who intrude and showering 
them in droplets whenever the underbrush is disturbed. A symphony of sounds 
assaults the ears from all directions, ranging from chirrups and croaks to 
strange, ominous buzzing. The humidity is stifling and the ground is difficult 
to walk upon, covered with fallen vines and exposed roots. The glint of 
rippling water is occasionally visible to the east, though the overgrown jungle 
obscures most details.

Deep Within A Humid Jungle~
   Progress is almost impossible here save for a few sparse paths through the 
overpowering vegetation. Solid walls of bushes and vines fill the gaps between 
trees, dripping perpetually with moisture and showering anyone nearby with 
droplets if disturbed. The place has a stifling and claustrophobic air, and 
visibility is very limited in places. The strong presence of pure life 
overwhelms the senses, and while travel through the area is sufficiently tough 
thanks to the physical obstacles, the heavy humidity lends additional 
difficulty to the process of clearing a way through this part of the 
rainforest.

occasionally visible to the east, though the overgrown jungle obscures most 
details. The surrounding jungle is dense, vegetation almost impenetrable in 
some places. Many branches have bowed under the weight of the water that has 
gathered on the leaves, making them prone to shedding a cascade of shimmering 
droplets when disturbed.

Abandoned Burrow~
   Life is abundant all around in its various guises, the thick vegetation 
pressing in on itself in constant competition for sunlight and space. Beneath 
the arching roots of a stand of trees a network of burrows appear to have 
supported some kind of community of mammals. An exposed chamber with 
connecting, narrow, tunnels leaves a man-sized hollow beneath the tree. 
Despite the destruction of its former purpose, it still appears to be in use by 
other creatures. Thick webbing fogs one of the small holes and rodents scurry 
in and out of another.

Further Along An Animal Track~
   Underbrush gathers all around, a track worn through it by the passage of 
moving things. It thickens southward like a barrier, making progress that way 
difficult but the track makes journeys east and west a little easier. The 
chirp of birds is loud and constant here, along with the frequent sound of 
things unseen as they dart quickly through the jungle.

Among Harsh, Thorny Underbrush~
   The lush greens and vibrant primary colours of the jungle ebb away as a 
different type of vegetation takes over. A breed of austere thornbush grows 
here, tangled and prickly with thorns the size of thumbtacks lining every 
branch. The growths are a drab grey and as unsightly as they are unpleasant. 
While not a real danger, the thorns scratch at skin and snag at fabrics from 
every direction. To the south and east, this inhospitable terrain continues 
while the less aggressive forestation picks back up to the west and north.

Approach To The Vista~
   Receding thorn scrub from the east gives way for broad leaf low lying plants 
and creeper vines that drape the hardy trees. Vibrant blooms attract bird and 
insect alike to sample syrupy nectar. Flutters of small colourful birds dart 
in and out like bullets, feeding and moving on in short order. The trees don't 
stand as densely here where competition for the thinner soil means smaller 
ground hugging foliage is king. This allows for a prelude of the impressive 
cliff top vista rather than an abrupt end to the land.

overhang, the jagged gaps of rockfalls remain as grim reminders of the 
dangerous environment.

loam ends. Part of a greater clearing, a corner looking out over the expansive 
venusian jungles, the call of birdsong invites and entices away from the edge 
of what is otherwise an incredible view. Off to the east almost hidden by the 
first rank of trees that lean across its mouth is a cave.

over by a whole community of insects in their relative isolation. The stone is 
of porous igneous gradient where visible, rough to the touch but also faintly 
warm. At its tallest the roof is four feet but toward the back its arc narrows 
considerably, a claustrophic pothole twisting away at a diagonal into the 
ground.

fairly bare here, exposed, moist earth visible in some places. They continue 
to stretch out to the south and west, although less spiky areas of the jungle 
continue in the other directions.

   Different trees and bushes all converge in a tangled clump here, knotted 
together in a thicket of bushes, some with broad leaves and other with spines. 
Passage through the clump is impossible, but various animals have worn a couple 
of intersection paths around it and a few holes too small for a person do lead 
inside. One tree to the north is entirely choked with some kind of climbing 
plant, its own leaves curling and browning at the edges while the parasitic 
weed flourishes, sprouting numerous clusters of bright red berries.

   Heavily humid, moisture seems to hang in the air here, making it seem 
chokingly and unpleasantly thick at times. Progress through is difficult, 
bushes sprouting in the gaps between trees, vines trailing across the few paths 
that snake through the area like giant cobwebs of fleshy green. All around, 
the noises of the jungle filter through, the buzz of insect wings, the beat of 
feathered ones and the occasional, sharp cry of some unidentified animal.

Amongst Striated Trees And Russet Vines~
   In this stretch of the jungle, the trees become more uniform. They have 
striated trunks similar to a taut cable, about a foot in thickness but very 
tall and straight. Their emerald green leaves hang in clusters from far above, 
none within reach, while a web of russet-colored vines is draped between the 
trunks like festooned chains. The jungle floor is relatively bare here, 
revealing the moist soil and myriad of insects that creep about before fleeing 
from any nearby movement.

Depths Of A Wildly Tangled Jungle~
   Progress here is difficult although a few paths do wind through the 
vegetation, which is thick. Dark green bushes with glossy leaves grow 
enthusiastically, interspersed with brilliant green ferns and a few long 
stalked flowers look out of place, their enormous magenta blooms appearing 
seemingly at random through the undergrowth. The murmur of running water is 
audible from here, although it's hard to pick out exactly where it's coming 
from, the vegetation seeming to muffle the sounds.

In The Thick Of The Jungle~
   The glint of rippling water is occasionally visible to the north, though the 
overgrown jungle obscures most details. All around, strange sounds emanate 
from the undergrowth, the flap of wings, odd croaking noises. The branches of 
bushes stir every now and then, scattering droplets of water that collect due 
to the oppressive, clinging humidity. Somewhere close, the sound of water is 
audible.

Forested Ledge Above A River~
   The chaotic rainforest continues, though the ground becomes more rocky 
towards the south until it reveals itself to be a cliff ledge overlooking a 
river. The trees and underbrush is no less dense here, but the hiss of rapid 
water becomes an audible background to the symphony of chirps and croaks that 
pulse from every direction. From the edge, the river is visible below and 
could be accessed with a short, safe jump, though the water itself may be more 
perilous than the drop from the ledge.

A Rocky Ledge Above A River~
   The rocky ground to the south becomes a ledge above a fast flowing river. 
It would be just a short drop into the water, but the river is murky and 
clouded and it's hard to see exactly how deep it is. The hiss and rush of the 
water is audible, now interspersed by the chirrups and other sounds of jungle 
life that come from every direction, the trees and bushes continuing right up 
to the water's edge.

On The Banks Of A Fast Flowing River~
   A tangle of trees line the river bank, which hovers above the clouded, brown 
water that cuts through the river. Reeds sprout too, thriving at the water's 
edge, their stalks heavy with bulbous heads that shed clouds of hazy seeds into 
the air when disturbed. Things croak from the bushes, the sounds sometimes 
alarmingly loud and the buzz of wings is an almost constant accompaniment as 
winged insects skim close to the surface of the water, sometimes to be plucked 
out of the air by the gaping, rubbery mouth of a fish that appears briefly and 
is then gone from sight.

Through Spiny Bushes On Moist Ground~
   In this part of the jungle, the vegetation become more uniform. The area is 
dominated by short, spiny bushes with yellowish-green leaves shaped like 
spades. Growing in large clusters that limit both visibility and progress, 
they seem to have forced out most other species of underbrush. The jungle 
floor is very moist and soft here, making it tiring to walk, though it seems to 
serve as the perfect environment for countless glossy worms that wriggle and 
writhe in the soil.

By The Remains Of A Fallen Tree~
   There are few trees here, the area ruled by spiny, spindly bushes relenting 
a bit in a brief, oddly shaped clearing where a fallen tree lies. While the 
tree seems dead, its corpse seems to provide plenty of life, one side of the 
enormous trunk crumbled away in an area of splintering, rotted wood now riddled 
with holes from which scurrying insects frequently emerge. Other plants too 
have found shelter against the tree and one kind of bush in particular, with 
fragrant leaves and branches full of drooping yellow and orange flowers is 
thriving all around.

Deep In Harsh, Thorny Bushes~
   All around, spiny covered bushes grow close together from the moss covered 
ground. A variety of mottled greys, they all boast thick, sharp looking spines 
that grab insistently at clothing while the moisture turns the moss underfoot 
slippery. Trees grow in the area too, widely spaced, their branches draped 
with vines that trail and hang like curtains. Insects buzz and the whirr of 
wings is sometimes audible, but this area of jungle seems quieter than in areas 
with more dense growth.

Amidst Thorny, Tangled Undergrowth~
   Thorny bushes grow together into tangled walls of spike laced vegetation 
here, some lacking leaves entirely so that they appear almost like skeletons of 
bushes. The thorns of one bush in particular are wickedly sharp, almost two 
inches long with clusters of unappealing looking grey berries protected by the 
spikes. In all directions but for the west, the thorny bushes continue.

Near The Cliff's Edge~
   Receding thorn scrub from the east gives way for broad leaf low lying plants 
and creeper vines that drape the hardy trees. Bright blossoms bob 
tantalizingly amidst the dark healthy green all around. The trees don't stand 
as densely here where competition for the thinner soil means smaller 
ground-hugging foliage is king. This allows for a prelude of the impressive 
cliff top vista rather than an abrupt end to the land. Trails of chunky ants 
column back and forth across the floor here, their return trail winding off 
toward the swampy ground to the south.

A Precarious Corner Of Cliff~
   From here, the view of the Venusian rainforest is clearly visible to the 
west, stretching out almost endlessly far below although the ground here just 
drops away, making passage that way impossible. It seems fairly stable, the 
dirt underfoot ending a little way and revealing the dark grey of basalt, this 
area presumably formed by some kind of volcanic activity. Indeed, the 
mountains to the north can be glimpsed easily through the trees and seem to be 
entirely formed of the same rock, scattered with greenery and vegetation and 
rising steadfastly into a range of peaks.

Breathtaking View At The Cliff's Edge~
   The jungle gradually thins until only the underbrush remains, and this 
yields as well as one approaches what seems to be the edge of the enormous 
cliff plateau of the area. Far below to the west, a vast expanse of more 
rainforest is visible, parted by a curving river and dotted with the occasional 
empty crater or small, squat volcano. It stretches as far as the eye can 
reach, disappearing into the distance where further terrain is blurred out of 
vision by the atmosphere's reflective clouds. It is a remarkable sight, miles 
of seemingly pristine terrain and untamed jungle.

A Tangle Of Thorny Bushes~
   The bushes here are a dull and dreary grey, thickly covered in clusters of 
thorns. Little else grows here beyond low lying greenery that sprouts up from 
the ground so that the earth is visible in many places, a rich, moist brown. 
To the east, the thorns continue, thickly tangled together although they seem 
to give up possession of the landscape further westward, where more color 
returns to the surroundings.

   Thorny, tangled bushes grow close together here, many of them lacking leaves 
so they seem like spiny skeletons with reaching, grabbing arms. Moss grows 
thickly at the bases of the bushes, springy and soft, clustered thickly on the 
damp ground. The smell of earth is strong here and the scent of rotting 
leaves, organic but not exactly unpleasant.

Marshy Ground In The Rainforest~
   The ground becomes increasingly marshy to the south. Water seeps out into 
every footprint and the humidity is stifling, moisture dripping from every leaf 
and vine. The sound of running water gets louder and more distinguishable from 
the omnipresent backdrop of buzzing and chirping. The soft, lush underbrush is 
accompanied here by a layer of slippery moss that covers every stone and log, 
growing more prominent the further south one goes.

   The jungle floor becomes softer further to the south until moisture seeps 
forth at every footstep. Bushes grow here with broad, dun-colored leaves, 
thriving along the edges of a curving stream that snakes its way southeast 
until it joins a bend in a fast-moving river. The vegetation is less dense 
towards the river bank, making the ground dangerously slippery. Across the 
river on the opposite bank, the dense trees take hold again, festooned with 
vines that droop lazily from the understory.

The Waters Of A River Through A Rainforest~
   Beyond the tangle of trees and bushes that line the banks, this river is 
wide enough to make crossing it involve wading through. Around waist deep, the 
water itself is fairly cold, clouded brown as its turgid, fast flowing motion 
stirs up a thick soup of mud from the bottom. Occasionally, something breaks 
the surface, a brief flash of a scaled limb or a pair of gasping, fishy lips 
visible for a few scant seconds before disappearing beneath the murky water.

In A Fast Flowing River Through The Rainforest~
   Waist deep water sloshes against the surrounding banks, leaving them soaking 
wet and turning the crumbling earth to treacherously slippery mud. The river 
moves westward with purpose, strong currents pulling in that direction with 
some insistence and a decent amount of force and making progress upstream 
difficult, although a journey across to the opposite bank seems possible.

The Muddy Waters Of A Rainforest River~
   Aided by a slight slope in the rainforest floor, the river heads westward at 
a decent pace, the surface of the muddy brown water in constant motion and torn 
by ripples. It glints when it catches the light, dappled where it creeps in 
through the gaps in the trees that line the bank, lending a hint of somehow 
mysterious beauty. The water is cold, easily waist deep and strong currents 
pull westward.

Reed Clumps On The Riverside~
   The nearby rock face absorbs some of the force of the water as it passes, 
allowing pockets of slower current to flow and support a community within the 
reeds. Small silvery fish dart about near the bank and long-legged birds stand 
amidst the reeds to wait on their unwitting prey. The riverbank becomes 
muddier further along where the river picks up speed on its outer limits but 
here it deceives at being slower than it actually is.

of by the larger trees and undergrowth that thrive here. Branches hang out 
over the water enjoying the mist thrown up by the rushing current.

trails long tendrils of green, fleshy vines which dip into the water. Its 
trunk is slick with a rich, blueish green algae which marks the bark a little 
above the waterline, the river briefly caressing the tree before continuing to 
flow on westward around a bend.

rushes onwards to its destination.

A Small Pond In The Swamp~
   The waters of the swamp have gathered here into a dark, murky pond. It is 
some thirty feet in diameter and deep enough in the middle to reach a man's 
chest. Teeming with life, the pond is home to a wide range of insects and 
small amphibians, though most are skittish and flee from any nearby movement. 
Strange, long-legged things with clear wings perch on the water's surface 
tension while beetles, worms and frogs creep around the banks of the pond. The 
thick stench of decaying organic matter assaults the nostrils, and the 
slime-covered limbs of dead trees jut from the pond in places while patches of 
green algae float on the still water. To the east, a thin belt of trees form a 
border before the bank of a sinuous river.

mushrooms and frilly orange fungi that liberally cover the softened, rotting 
wood.

River Bank At A Moss-Covered Cliff~
   The watery sludge of the swamp melds into the bank of a river here. A low 
ridge of cliff rises to the west, covered with rich green moss a full three 
feet above the water. Further in that direction, the subdued roar of a 
waterfall is audible, though the cliff obscures its from sight. Spindly winged 
insects buzz through the air and perch on the still parts of the water before 
it meets the river proper, and the strange croaks of amphibians is a constant 
presence in this area.

Swamp Near A River~
   The soft, mushy ground makes passage difficult here, as does the oppressive 
humidity. Care must be taken to avoid sinking to mid-calf in the watery 
sludge, and every surface is covered by a layer of slick moss and mud. 
Treacherously drooping vegetation obstructs travel in many directions, and 
slimy tendrils cling to anyone who comes into contact with the vines and dead 
logs that drape across the terrain. A river is visible in places to the south, 
though it is the sound that first reveals its presence.

Miasmic Bog Amidst The Swamp~
   The swamp continues in all directions, spreading like a bruised fruit. It 
is thickest here, almost too humid to breathe, an effect that is only enhanced 
by the putrid organic matter festooned across the area. Sloughing trees droop 
towards the brackish water and brown vines criss-cross the bog, limiting both 
movement and visibility. The surface is a perilous mire of dark water and 
loose, slimy mud, and croaking sounds pulse incessantly from unseen sources.

Marshy River Bank Lined With Trees~
   The marshy forest floor continues right down to the bank of a river on the 
eastern edge of the swamp. The trees grow taller and more frequent near the 
fresh water, and they continue several feet into the river itself where they 
grow directly out of the water, roots visible under the surface before they 
merge into the slim, greyish trunks of these tall jungle growths. The 
underbrush is sparse here, though passage remains difficult due to the soft, 
wet soil that sucks exhaustingly at every footstep.

sludge and mud and thick with fronds of pond weeds. Reeds grow at the sides 
near the banks too, where mounds of earth laced with tree roots and lush with

unmistakeable roar of its passing ensures it does not go forgotten. Low 
hanging vines choke what natural gaps exist for passage and broad leafed bushes 
spread themselves thickly at knee height, festooned with luscious berries and 
beautiful flowers. The air is thick with clouds of water-borne insect, as much 
in their element.

Deep In The Jungle~
   Lush greenery presses in on all sides in constant competition for sunlight, 
resources, and bloom exposure to the various critters that help spread their 
seed. Thick roots threaten to trip the unwary, like the bony fingers of a 
crone reaching out for the best possible soil. Sticky moisture clings to 
everything, condensation trapped by the greenhouse effect of the inpenetrable 
canopy above.

Natural Alcove By The Cliff Face~
   A vertical cliff wall rises up through the dense jungle vegetation, peppered 
with climbing vines and hardy flowers that cling to the rocky surface. It 
creates a natural alcove looking onto the river where the fertile ground gives 
rise to a whole host of colour and variety. The area from roots to canopy is 
teeming with life, a cacophany of bird call with an bassline insect buzz.

Deep Jungle By The Cliff Face~
   Verdant greens crowd in on all sides, disorientating similarities between 
one tree and the next. It is only the solid ascension of the cliff face to the 
east that offers any sense of bearing. It reaches up into the lower canopy, 
the sheer rock covered with hardy little plants and creeping vines. Mulchy 
leaf litter makes the ground underfoot soft and uncertain.

Through The Jungle Sprawl~
   The ground dips and rises in a chaotic tumble of roots, fallen trees, and 
healthy giants that extend for hundreds of metres upwards. Upon the mound 
here, a tree beset with parasitic creeping vines stands at an awkward angle to 
which its neighbours have adapted. A sea of constantly changing green, of 
bewildering uniformity that promises new features with every turn. A dizzying 
spiral of activity awash with exotic animal calls in all its captivating 
majesty.

A Stretch Of Fast Flowing River~
   A brief ribbon of sky is visible overhead where the branches of overhanging 
trees don't quite meet on either side of this wide stretch of river. Many of 
the trees hunch over, trailing branches thick with leaves into the brown, cold 
water, the flow of it tugging them southwards to where the river starts into a 
curve. It's not too deep here, the weed choked bottom easy enough to touch 
although the water reaches to well above waist level.

A Marshy, Tree Lined River Bank~
   The ground underfoot is soft and wet, water from the river that curls around 
from the east and continues on southward seeping out. Everything is 
waterlogged and mushy although that doesn't seem to have slowed the growth of 
the vegetation. Trees rise up out of the water, reeds with great fluffy seed 
heads flourish and grasses of lush and vibrant greens dominate closer to the 
river.

On A Rock Butte In The Swamp~
   Out of the swamp rises a small hill of rock, roughly twenty feet in diameter 
and relatively round. It slopes gently upwards and is easily accessed from 
below, though the southern side is covered by spongy green moss. A slab sits 
half-sunken into the swamp. Visibility is no better from the top, but it is 
dry and offers some refuge from the moist, unpleasant bog below. Rapid water 
can be heard from the south, indicating the presence of a river.

River And A Huge, Dead Log~
   The swamp opens up to a river bank to the west, though an expanse of still, 
brackish water lies before it, shielded from the river itself by a huge, dead 
log that has fallen across the way. Almost four feet in diameter, it is 
covered with moss and spiny plants on the top while tendrils of greenish slime 
hang from the underside where it juts out of the water. Access to the river 
from this direction would require wading through the stinking, cloudy water. 
Long-legged insects buzz about on translucent wings while amphibian croaks 
pulse from every direction.

At A Bend In The River~
   The roar and rush of water from the west is loud and impossible to ignore, 
the river heading steadfastly in that direction. The constant motion of it 
crashing against the northern bank has left it just a slippery bank of mud, 
choked with plants and ferns that thrive at the water's edge. The water itself 
is clouded, heavy with kicked up sediment, the surface broken every now and 
then by a a variety of sleek, slimy and scaled forms.

At The Edge Of A Waterfall~
   Several large boulders have gathered in the river here, providing a kind of 
lip although the water crashes up through the gaps and plummets over the edge, 
the roar of it almost overpowering as it cascades into the air and then plunges 
violently into a pool far below. The green treetops are visible to either side 
of the pool, a river emerging from the haze of white spray and then snaking 
lazily through the jungle until it is lost from sight between the trees.

In A Fast Flowing River~
   The water in this section of the river is murky with mud from the bottom is 
stirred up by the motion of it as it approaches a bend and continues to lurch 
onward, choppy and almost fierce at times. The banks to the west are too steep 
to scramble up over, whatever is beyond them obscured by thick trees and bushes 
that have grown into a wild tangle. Somewhere close is a low but constant and 
insistent droning noise.

Verdant River Bank Near A Swamp~
   The swamp to the north gives way to a wide, sinuous river that snakes 
through the dense rainforest. Rich vegetation grows along the bank like a 
natural border between the dim swamp and the rapid waters, standing out in 
stark contrasts of lush green against the browns to the north. Here, the trees 
stop several yards from the bank, giving way to shorter and wilder underbrush 
with even less solid ground to walk upon. Every step is treacherous, sinking 
deeper until the swamp is waist deep before the river begins in earnest.

River Bank Near A Rock Butte~
   The rocky ground to the north slopes down until the moist soil begins again, 
giving life to a thin belt of leafy underbrush that blocks visibility moreso 
than passage. Beyond is the shallow river bank, a simple ledge of slippery mud 
that dips into the sinuous river. It can be seen continuing to the west while 
it bends northward to the east and snakes out of view. Across the river, trees 
grow out of the water and obscure the terrain in that direction.

A Lazy Bend In The River~
   This meandering curve of river twists lazily from the north and curls around 
to the east, the marshy ground surrounding seeming to almost merge into the 
cool, brown water as the bank of sodden earth slopes downwards to meet it. 
Broken twigs swirl and dance, tugged into motion by the currents so that they 
spin around, tugged down every now and then by some unseen force only to bob up 
again moments later.

A Bend In A Sinuous River~
   A bank of crumbling earth dominates the eastern bank of the river here, the 
top of it far too high to provide any kind of way out. The edges of dark grey 
stones can just be made out in places through the deep, rich green algae and 
the soil that provides a brown hue to the cold, fast moving water that snakes 
around in a lazy curve to the west, perhaps seeming to gain some momentum 
judging by the ripples that break the surface of the water as the river 
disappears from sight. Directly to the south, a small cliff rises out of the 
jungle floor.

Thriving Jungle Near A River~
   The jungle is exceedingly lush here, enjoying unrestrained growth near the 
nourishing waters of the river. Bountiful vegetation sprouts from the ground 
and the canopies above are heavily laden with vines. To the southwest, a cliff 
rises some fifty feet out of the ground while to the east is a dried tributary 
that winds its way through the abundant underbrush. Bunches of ferns and other 
small plants make it difficult to see the ground, but the constant symphony of 
insects is a sure sign of their presence.

Dip In The Jungle Floor~
   A steep sloping angle presents itself when cresting the treeline leading 
down into a leafy gulley. Low lying bushes and weak-rooted plants provide some 
handholds on the way up and down its otherwise acute angle. Muddy slicks 
suggest animal traffic with less graceful means pass through here, though any 
tracks are lost in the dense leaf litter and foliage around the bottom.

Lush Gulley In The Jungle Floor~
   Perhaps once a tributary of the river, this natural groove in the ground 
forms a short valley that has long since become overrun with smaller plants. 
Tiny burrows make for treacherous stepping, well hidden beneath the spreadagled 
ferns. At each end and either of the gulley the incline is steep, a mulched 
collection of groundfall recycled into enriching the prized soil here.

The moist vegetation is less dense in an area around the side of the large 
rock, revealing a small but passable opening in its base. To the north and 
west, the rainforest continues on its way.

   More of the jungle is visible from this vantage. A rapid river runs its 
course directly below this cliff, and beyond it to the northwest is a watery 
swamp. To the east is a small mountain around which the river curves, and to 
the west is the foamy crest of a waterfall that tumbles over the edge of the 
plateau that this rainforest calls home. One could jump into the river from 
this rock, but it is no trivial dive and could be painful.

one branch of murky brown heading south while another careens off to the west, 
pace increasing as the tilt of the ground slopes down. The currents pull in 
different directions and the water batters the surrounding mounds of greenery 
shrouded earth that form the river's banks, crashing into it almost violently 
in some places and sending sprays of water over the sides.

   The track of the river slops westwards and downhill a little, the speed of 
the cool, muddied water increasing until the flow is noticeably faster, pulling 
in that direction. It sloshes noisily against the bank of earth to the north, 
making gulping, sucking noises as it turns the soil to a treacherous slide of 
mud and crumbling soil. The bottom is out of reach and the river and stretches 
further south in a confused tangle of swirling currents, while a strong 
undercurrent threatens from below.

   The flow of the water has worn away the soil of the bank south, revealing a 
network of tree roots that are slimy with algae, coiled in the earth like 
buried bones and protruding into the river. The water itself is cool but not 
cold, the tug of the current firm and persuasive, dragging everything westward 
in its murky grip. A thick, sucking mud coats the river bed, providing an 
anchor for the feathery, clinging pond weeds and reeds that make their home 
here.

fleshy vines that graze the water's surface and almost seem to knot with the 
fronds of reeds that burst upwards, too steep to gain any purchase on and 
escape the fast flow of the cool water. Overhead, the sky with its masses of 
roiling clouds is clearly visible through a ragged gap in the trees the width 
of the river and all around, insects buzz and whirr like miniature hover 
vehicles, sometime visible in a brief, iridescent blur.

Trees Along The River~
   There is not much of a river bank. Instead, trees simply grow several feet 
into the river, their roots visible through the water before they join the 
trunk and extend upwards into the canopy. Algae drifts past the gnarled limbs, 
collecting around each until the current pulls it onwards. Further to the 
south, the water turns to sludge and sludge eventually turns to relatively 
solid ground again, though it remains difficult to walk upon and threatens to 
swallow every footstep. West of here, a cliff rises from the jungle floor, 
though the dull roar of a waterfall seems to come from beyond.

roots dangling into the water where bits of algae float on past, dragged into

the ground is heavily waterlogged and boggy although it seems to grow more 
solid a little distance away, the swamp here relatively small and confined.

the roots of the trees that burst through and dangle into the water like dead, 
greying limbs, heavy with moss and algae that clings like decay. The bottom is 
easy to each, a soft, thick mud that sucks at the feet as if unwilling to let 
go. Lush, thick reeds line the banks, the air above them hazy with small 
insects, the buzz of tiny wings mingling with the sloshing sound of the water.

   The trees are dense here, so dense that their canopies form an opaque

under this natural roof, leaving it slightly chilly and less lush. Instead, 
tough and hardy weeds grow on the ground in rugged clusters, threatening to 
trip the unwary. To the west, a cliff butte rises out of the ground. Just 
beyond, a small cliff rises out of the jungle floor, forming a butte.

interesting. Some swampland is visible far to the west while a cave cuts into 
the small mountain to the east. The noisy river splits to the west under this 
butte, carving its way around a line of trees. To the east, the canopies of 
the jungle bar any passage.

created that fronts onto a broad mouthed recess in the cliff face to the 
southeast. To the north the ground descends steeply for a spell.

   The interior of the cave provides a little cool in comparison to the jungle 
climes, its darkness permeated by the faint glow of luminescent worms. The 
occasional rocky column pans the height of the cave, some of them broken off

The ground is mostly bare but for a few tough specimens that find root in the

Where A Cave Opens Into A Valley~
   The cavern opens up here, widening into an open space to the east. The 
jungle vegetation takes hold just outside the mouth of the cave, looking like 
an enclosed valley in the middle of this small mountain. Back to the west, the 
dark cave continues stoically.

Secluded Valley In The Center Of A Volcano~
   An enclosed valley winds its way through the center of this small mountain, 
filling out an area the likeness of the hole in a donut. Looking up at the 
steep, blackened cliff walls makes it clear that this is the center of an old, 
long-dead volcano. The vegetation is lush and abundant, but there are less 
trees and more large, sprouting ferns and natural trellises of vines. Clusters 
of leaves hang invitingly from the low trees, and though it is difficult to 
move through, one might continue northwards through the short, sheltered 
valley.

Through A Deep, Overgrown Trench~
   The valley narrows for a stretch, becoming more of a trench. The plants are 
bunched together and difficult to travel through, requiring liberal use of 
machetes or hatchets. Long, shaggy ferns drape across the way to the north and 
the area has no trees at all, only dense bushes and other plentiful underbrush. 
The steep rock walls rise up hundreds of feet to either side, revealing this 
area as the inside of an ancient volcano.

Near-Impassable Tangle Of Plants~
   The underbrush is incredibly thick here, tangled together like one great 
bush. It is almost impossible to move through, but a natural path of slightly 
thinner growths winds its way from south to north. The enclosing cliff walls 
are practically invisible in the chaotic tangle of greens and browns, and the 
place is not lenient on the claustrophobically inclined.

In A Long, Lush Valley~
   The space opens up here, becoming an actual valley again. It bends, turning 
north to west along a natural path. Palm-like trees thrive along the edges 
under the cliff walls while thick, shaggy grasses form a carpet throughout the 
area. Large, drooping plants grow in clusters here and there, and mosses cover 
the first four feet of the surrounding rock barriers. This is the center of a 
long-dead volcano, overgrown and thriving in its natural shelter.

   The vegetation relents here, leaving the area to open up into a lavish 
natural garden. A thin carpet of soft grass covers the ground while patches of 
flowers and small shrubberies dot the terrain. It is rather quiet here and 
very secluded, being enclosed by the sheer rock walls on all sides save the 
path that leads eastward into the valley. There is something serene about this 
place, like a calming presence.

In A Corner Of The Drab Cave~
   The cave comes to an uninteresting end here, narrowing into a bare corner. 
Lips of fungi grow on the rock wall and the occasional rocky column stretches 
from floor to ceiling, but there is little else of note here. To the north, 
light filters in from an opening in the stone. All around the cavern, dots of 
faintly glowing light suggests the existence of luminescent worms.

   The mouth of the cave opens up to the jungle beyond while its depths are 
invisible from here, lost in the gloom of the rock. The occasional glowing 
spot suggests the presence of luminescent worms, but they do not illuminate the 
area. The rock walls are bare and craggy, and the whole place is rather 
featureless.

A Tumble Of Boulders~
   Like a jungle rockery, the spill of boulders broken away from the cliff face 
create a miniature landscape. A creeping spread of vines threaten to cover the 
assortment of rocks as well as a healthy spatter of obligatory dark green moss. 
Not to be outdone, opportunist insects have created a colony in soil between 
the cracks, scurrying back and forth on errands. To the east the dark mouth of 
a cave yawns with no obvious occupants of its own.

Trekking Through Hardy Jungle~
   The jungle is particularly tough here, consisting mainly of a sort of wiry, 
chaotic underbrush. Natural trellises obstruct passage in many places and the 
vegetation is extremely tangled. The jungle's auditory presence is undaunted, 
playing its endless symphony of croaks, chirps, buzzes and screeches from all 
directions. The faint scent of a nearby swamp hangs in the air.

Steady Rise In The Jungle Floor~
   The jungle floor rises up here, climbing onto a rocky ramp to the north. 
There it continues onto a cliff butte some fifty feet high, but the path is not 
too steep to walk. South of here, the river ends in a lake while to the east 
the jungle continues undaunted. The air is alive with buzzing insects and the 
humid, organic scents of the rainforest.

A Tree Lined River~
   Tree roots trail into the water here, knotted together in places. The river 
itself snakes around in a bend to the south where it continues eastward towards 
a lake, the flow pulling in that direction. Further north, it seems to widen, 
the water rushing in from that direction, still cold and heavy with sediment 
that makes it murky.

Waterlogged Ground By A river~
   The river to the north seems unwilling to keep with the gouge it has dug out 
of the landscape and encroaches here, sloshing over the roots of the trees that 
line the banks. It's probably flooded over the banks entirely at some point in 
the past, accounting for the water that has turned the area south of here into 
a marshy swamp with looping tree roots that occasionally protrude from the 
murky surface of the brackish water.

Among Numerous Trees In The Rainforest~
   Trees in a variety of sizes from tiny saplings to towering giants loom all 
around here, their branches meeting overhead in a canopy, their roots making 
the jungle floor uneven. A blanket of leaves in hundred shades between green 
and brown carpet the ground and all around, the flutter of wings can be heard, 
along with the cooing of birds and less easy to identify noises that must be 
animals of some kind.

On Solid Ground Near A Swamp~
   North of here, the ground becomes increasingly damp and soft, heavily 
saturated with water from the river beyond. It's solid enough for now though, 
scattered with a rich looking mulch of partly rotted leaves that have fallen 
from the trees. They grow fairly thickly but seem to thin out a little further 
south, a large rock visible between the trunks that vary in thickness from 
barely a handspan to great organic behemoths too wide for two people to link 
arms around.

A Ledge Overlooking The Rainforest~
   This ledge is sheltered from the north by rocks which obscure the view in 
that direction, just leaving the western view open. It's jaw-dropping, just 
miles and miles of rainforest visible almost as far as the eye can see although 
shapes of craters and volcanoes can be made out beneath the lush greenery and 
the glint of a river too. The horizon is hazy, too far out to really 
distinguish but there might be a faint glimmer there too, perhaps of water 
although it's hard to say with any certainty.

beyond which the vast and seemingly unending rainforest continues to stretch 
out far below. A sinuous river cuts through the greenery and the a couple of 
odd conical shapes rise up and few craters are visible too, although vegetation 
has covered almost everything, swathing it in a lush blanket of green. Grasses 
and ferns cover this area, continuing on eastward where a large bit of rock 
juts up out of the earth.

   A large piece of rock emerges from the earth here, fine grained basalt 
ringed with grasses that brush lightly around it. The top is fairly flat, 
etched with moss, the rock sitting a little left of centre of a small clearing. 
Southwards, the entrance of a cave is visible while westward, this level of the 
rainforest seems to end in a drop.

A Quiet Area Of Rainforest~
   It's quiet here, the low hanging branches of several large trees seeming to 
dampen the sound. The murmur of insects is still audible, but it's softer. 
The trees themselves are plentiful, although they don't grow too closely 
together, many of them stooped and hunched over with great curtains of trailing 
branches with numerous small green leaves.

Verdant River Bank In The Swamp~
   The swamp gives way to a wide, sinuous river that snakes through the dense 
rainforest. Rich vegetation grows along the bank like a natural border between 
the dim swamp and the rapid waters, standing out in stark contrasts of lush 
green against the browns to the north. Here, the trees stop several yards from 
the bank, giving way to shorter and wilder underbrush with even less solid 
ground to walk upon. Every step is treacherous, sinking deeper until the swamp 
is waist deep before the river begins in earnest.

brown, cold but rising to no deeper than chest height on an average sized 
person. All around, trees and bushes line the banks and further southward, the 
waterlogged ground of the swamp starts up again.

A Murky, Clouded Lake~
   The river seems to lose all momentum as it gathers here, collecting into a 
deep lake. It seeps past the confines of its banks in numerous small streams, 
blending into the marshy ground that creeps up to the edge of it, where bushes 
make escape difficult. The water itself is clouded and dark, the surface 
constantly shifting with ripples and dappled shade thrown onto it by the 
surround trees, making it impossible to see if anything lurks beneath.

Before A Sharp Drop Into A Chasm~
   The passage of jungle through the mountains comes to an abrupt, unexpected 
stop at the southern edge of this area, where it cuts at a steep angle to 
plummet deep and far into the wide, green gulch below. The side of the cliff 
that faces the chasm is heavily carpeted with plant life and vines, but nothing 
strong enough to gain purchase on for a climb down. It is impossible to see 
the chasm floor from here through the thick canopy of trees, though it seems 
safe to determine the sudden drop is more than enough to break a few bones.

   A rough and tumble trip down, this steep slope begins at the top of a cliff 
before ascending sharply downward. The rock is grey and solid though numerous 
pebbles are stuffed in the crannies and shake loose when the space is being 
scaled. To aid in climbing back up, vines from the jungle at the top of the 
cliff drape downward, trying desperately to find purchase and in some cases 
splitting the rock.

Marshy Ground Around A Murky Lake~
   The river from the west slows gradually until it ends here in a deep, 
rippling lake. Leafy bushes and small, pliable trees grow along its edge, 
sprouting from the spongy ground into an interwoven, near-impassable barrier 
along the edge of the water. The lake is dark and cloudy, making it difficult 
to see if anything lives within. To the south, the underbrush thins out again 
in favor of an expanse of watery mire, and further in that direction looms a 
forbidding cliff wall. East of here, the rainforest takes hold again.

swampy ground again takes hold to the south. To the east, the river narrows 
into a stream and eventually ends in a lake.

Fetid Swamp Near A River~
   Though a fast-moving river is both visible and audible to the north, this 
part of the rainforest has turned into fetid swampland. Murky water gathers in 
shallow pools here and there, containing all manner of insects and amphibians, 
while slime-covered brown vines droop from the low trees with black trunks that 
grow in this particular area. The stench of decaying organic matter assaults 
the senses, and the humidity is stifling.

   A great wall of rock curves around to the southwest, encrusted with greenery 
that has taken hold and made its home in the dark grey stone. The trees stop a 
little short of it and wild grasses seem to take over, spreading further 
southwards. The wind frequently sends ripples through them, so from here it 
looks like a green and gold ocean that stretches out until it meets a cliff.

ragged tear in the stone. Shoots of greenery curl down from above and below, 
growing up the side of the cliff and partially obscuring the crevice, although 
only darkness can be seen behind. Plants grow too, fleshy specimens with 
drooping carmine heads, leggy stalked bushes with tulip shaped blooms and a 
scatter of tiny plants with clusters of blue and yellow flowers.

green where vegetation has taken hold and managed to grow in the cracks. This 
area is free from trees, barring a few small, weeding looking saplings, covered 
instead in grasses and clumps of ferns that erupt from the soil, blanketing the 
area in shades of gold and green.

spreading dampness that emanates from the cold stone and fills this whole area.

Moss and lichen reign here, feeding off the moisture that seems to seep from

ground is slippery in places with slime and odd looking, stringy white fungi 
crowd like miniature ghosts on small ledges and crevices, nestled in the moist 
soil.

the rock while vines dangle down from above. Grasses grow everywhere in a 
dozen shades of green and brown and a few trees provide cover, although much of 
the sky is visible, the main canopy of the jungle stopping a little way off. 
In several places paths run through the grass, which has been worn away by the 
passage of animals.

Here though, it remains solid, blanketed with fallen leaves that have rotted 
into a fragrant mulch. It's shady, holes in the canopy meaning that light 
filters through at odd angles, glimpses of the marsh water glinting when seen 
through the silvery, slender trunks of the trees that spread out around here, 
stretching their many limbed branches over the area.

A Mire Of Still, Murky Water~
   The ground here is marshy, almost watery sludge. Pools have gathered in 
places, barely an inch deep but murky and unclean. The vegetation turns from 
its usual green to dark browns and blacks, often dead or covered in slimy moss. 
Winged insects buzz through the humid air and swarm above the still waters 
while the croaks and clicks of unseen wildlife is projected back and forth 
across the area in ceaseless rhythms. To south, a steep cliff wall rises 
abruptly from the jungle swamp while the breath of a rapid river can be heard 
from the north. Westward, the trees and underbrush grows verdant again.

A Bubbling Swamp Pit~
   Scraggly trees with minimal leaf growth on the branches are scattered about 
the edge of this muddy expanse. Nothing grows in the center where air pockets 
escape to the surface and pop open. Despite the distance from the river, the 
muck only gets deeper and holds more securely to anything sinking into its 
depths. The cliff wall remains off in the distance to the southeast as it 
rounds back up. The cliff becomes more of a short ledge off to the east, 
needing to step up about a foot beyond the surface of the bubbling mud. Tiny 
insects are thicker in this area, evidenced by the constant buzzing as they zip 
past or even land for a bite.

A Cramped Undergound Clearing~
   The thick, unyielding basalt walls that surround this dark, vaguely circular 
space have been eroded smooth by ancient, now absent rivers of lava. The stone 
is nearly black in color here, save for the thin mineral veins that glimmer 
faintly when touched by any sort of light, signifying a likely presence of 
mineral deposits hidden underneath. A western tunnel, only about four feet 
high, feeds into a smaller, almost identical chamber and the ground begins to 
slope upward towards the south. Save for a few small boulders, this ten foot 
wide room is more or less clear of any natural debris and it has an approximate 
ceiling of seven feet tall at most.

A Cramped Underground Chamber~
   A short, eastern tunnel feeds into this small, cramped, underground area. 
Though the walls here are composed of the same ash-black stone as the 
neighboring chamber, large sections lack the melted, smoothed quality. 
Instead, thick, rocky spikes of jagged basalt threaten to cut and impale 
careless hands. The chamber is only large enough to fit three or four grown 
men and it has a meager five feet of ceiling.

   The cave opens up overhead into an unexpectedly vast cavern, a huge, 
unevenly arched roof stretching overhead, filled with tiny black bodies that 
hang like rotting fruits. Underfoot, the ground is slick with an extremely 
slippery white and black flecked substance that has collected in great mounds 
and the flutter of leathery wings is frequent, the creatures that live above 
stirring in great clouds when disturbed although they seem to have some other 
way out, as few ever come down this low.

A Grassy Corner By Cliffs~
   Only a few trees grow in this quiet sheltered spot and they seem to be young 
with slender, springy branches full of light green leaves and sprigs bursting 
with vivid pink blossom. The rest of the area has been taken over by a variety 
of grasses, sometimes waist deep although a number of paths have been flattened 
through, especially closer to the cliffs. Many have bursting seed heads at the 
tops of their skinny stalks that look like explosions of white above the green, 
others has golden coloured flowers that cluster in bunches above them.

By A Caved In Arch Of Rock~
   A great curved arch of rock that used to stand to the south has mostly caved 
in, cutting off access in that direction. It seems to have been a fairly 
recent fall, the vegetation having barely established itself on the tumble of 
broken stone. East and west, the cliffs stretches out, flanked by trees that 
partially obscure it while the jungle continues northward for what seems like 
forever.

Deeper Into A Mountain Pool~
   Surrounded on all sides by moss covered rock, the water of this tropical 
pool is pleasantly warm but somewhat murky, sediment and mud stirred up by the 
waterfall that plunges down from above. The bottom is easily within reach, a 
tumble of angular rocks and a carpet of reeds and the fronds of underwater 
plants felt rather than seen. The waterfall itself is spectacular, a deluge of 
water that tumbles some distance from overhead in a wide sheet of water that 
meets that of the pool in a roiling mass of white foam.

   Little else is visible now but for the white spray of water that seems all 
encompassing now, perhaps a blur of the sky visible from some angles and a 
flash of green from another although all sense of direction has been lost in 
the dizzying tumbling fall. The roar of water seems almost like a scream now, 
deafeningly loud and painfully, terrifyingly close.

the roar of the cold, viciously swirling water audible.

direction through heavy vegetation. Trees and bushes laden with vines grow in 
a tangle, while fungi, mosses and flowers grow lower to the ground. The cover 
provided by the trees is fairly dense, but cracks of sky are visible through 
gaps in the canopy.

   Westward, the jungle is squeezed into a relatively narrow belt, pressed 
between the mountains that rise up above the canopy to the north and the 
mountain that cuts a swathe through the trees to the south. Trees grow 
haphazardly here, great towering monsters that fight and jostle for space, the 
branches of one fitted into a complex jigsaw puzzle shape against the next. 
Their roots tell a similar story, sometimes bunched up and protruding from the 
leaf strewn ground where a variety of lower level greenery spreads like 
wildfire.

   Grey rocks curve around, bulging out from the mountainside a bit into this 
area. The undergrowth is scrubby, fairly sparse, all the trees a little weedy 
looking. They seem somewhat shallowly rooted in the loose soil of the ground, 
nowhere near as lush as much of the rest of the forest although the lower 
bushes and plants thickly blanket the jungle floor, growing in a rich bed of 
fallen leaves. Southwards, the murmur of water is audible, perhaps a flash of 
it visible through the trees some distance away.

Sparse Jungle Near The Mountains~
   Poorly rooted trees grow here, thin and almost sickly looking with narrow 
trunks and peeling layers of silver bark. Their branches droop and hang as if 
the weight of the meagre leaves is too much for them, brushing against the 
ground where smaller plants seem to be thriving. They nestle in the roots of 
the trees, dozens of different varieties of delicate ferns and flourishing 
grasses mixed in with fleshy looking flowers with fat stems and brightly 
coloured blooms. To the north and east, the mountains tower while the jungle 
presses in all around.

   Basalt cliffs occupy the space to the north, curving around to the east and 
jutting out a bit, biting into the rainforest which continues to encroach upon 
it, undeterred. The rocks are a deep, dark grey with angular edges, occasional 
streaks of rusty red smeared across them and more frequent spaces of green 
where moss has grown into the cracks. The trees stop some distance from the 
mountain itself, the loose soil providing a poor anchor for their roots 
although a number of bushes with broad, russet coloured leaves seem quite 
content here.

   Part of the cliff to the north has collapsed, pillars of basalt shattered

grown up around the gaps like a kind of mortar, their roots probing the cracks 
and seeming to bind them all together. Some larger cracks show signs of 
frequent passage to what must be burrows within them, the entrances not quite 
obscured behind trampled, bruised vegetation.

jungle floor which is a mass of broken twigs and dead and rotting leaves that 
provide a rich bed for the plants on the ground. They are numerous, seeming to 
thrive despite the canopy above which obscures much of the sky, leaving only 
mosaic-like cracks through which it is visible. Some boast vibrant flowers, 
others exotic shaped blooms in ghostly, green tinted whites while others have 
only leaves, some wildly splashed with blotches of contrasting green.

winding curves of a river can sometimes be seen off to the south as it presses 
its way through the jungle. The humidity here is stifling at times, the air 
almost possessing a kind of solidity although the leaves on the tangled trees 
and bushes are frequently stirred into motion by a cooler breeze that cuts 
through, perhaps coming off the water or maybe over the towering tops of the 
mountain range.

   Trees cluster on the bank of a wide river to the south, hunched over it and 
lazily tumbling leaf laden branches if eager to drink from the fast flowing, 
murky waters. Insects buzz almost constantly here and birds flit between the 
trees, sometimes visible when outlined against the section of sky left above 
the water, escaping out through a crack in the canopy. The ground is solid 
even close to the water's edge, the river itself accessible via a short drop 
although its depth is impossible to gauge from here.

distance to the north, cliffs climb up higher still, shrouded with hanging

is fairly intense and the sounds of jungle life are constant and relentless, a 
mixture of birdsong, strange animal calls and the whirr of insects' wings.

continuing on at a considerably reduced volume, gulping and sucking at the 
earth that keeps it on track as it sloshes against the sides. The pace seems 
to quicken, possibly due to the pressure of water trying to squeeze through the 
gap. Northwards, the jungle continues.

A Wide Stretch Of River~
   The flow of water from the east opens out into this wide pool, surrounded on 
the south by cliffs and penned in to the north by the steep river banks so that 
the surface of the water is almost constantly in shade, a definite chill to it. 
This stretch of water seems less murky although the bottom is impossible to 
see, perhaps the vague outlines of unidentifiable shapes lurking below the 
surface visible every now and then.

At A Point Where The River Widens~
   Northwards, the bank towers far ahead, well out of reach from within the 
water. The southern bank looks like an easier way to escape the river, an area 
of rock that sticks out from the cliffs in a sheltered overhang, covered with 
moss but not so high that scrambling out is impossible. To the west, the cold, 
murky brown waters of the river widen out into a pool that lurks in the shade 
of the cliffs. Some distance above, a log spans the gap between the cliff to 
the south and the forested rise to the north.

A River Shaded By Cliffs~
   The river cuts its way westward, flowing fairly fast and with definite 
intent, the current strong enough that progress upstream is hard going. To the 
south is a small area of river bank, beyond which a great mass of cliffs jut up 
out of the ground, their angular shape softened by the trailing vegetation that 
drapes down from far, far above. There are plants that grow on the banks too, 
mostly smallish saplings and bushes with few leaves and long spikes, along wish 
some beautiful grasses who shed their frothy seeds into the water to be carried 
along and washed ashore in other parts of the rainforest.

   Trees press in on the river to the south, crowding in around the waters 
edge. Part of the bank has collapsed, sunk into the water and one tree has 
been tilted and now grows at an angle, a few of its wide branches extending 
almost parallel to the water. It provides a kind of stepped access to the 
river, a route frequently used by wildlife, judging by the churned up mud and 
the trampled reeds and rushes that grow around that area, a definite and 
noticeable path cut into the greenery.

Thick Venusian Jungle~
   The trees here grow close and almost knotted together in places, their 
branches intertwined as if engaged in some kind of a dance. Two trees in 
particular are literally locked together where one has half fallen and the 
other has grown up around it, their bond cemented further by the vines that 
have sprouted up around them. The sound of running water is audible at times 
from somewhere to the west, perhaps a little muffled by the fairly dense 
curtains of leaves that droop from low hanging branches.

A Tangle Of Thick, Dense Rainforest~
   The trees here seem to have relatively straight trunks with smooth bark and 
not much in the way of lower branches, meaning that they grow close together so 
that picking a straight path through them is all but impossible. Progress 
through the area is mad harder by the tangled undergrowth that has thrives in 
this moist, sheltered area and all around, unseen creatures rustle the leaves, 
occasionally breaking the relative quiet with a sharp and sometimes startling 
cry.

Thinning Rainforest Not Far From A Cliff~
   The imposing grey of basalt cliffs loom through the trees that thin out to 
the north, the vegetation here a little more sparse than in other areas, a 
brief respite from the thicker jungle to the west. The jungle floor is heavily 
matted with broken twigs and dead leaves wherever bushes and other plants have 
not taken over and when visible, the soil is a rich and deep brown, very moist. 
It moves sometimes, stirred by tiny insects that make their home down on the 
lowest level of the jungle.

At The Bottom Of A Craggy Cliff~
   Vines trail down over the basalt cliffs to the north, dangling over the 
craggy rock face. Many plants seem have nestled in the cracks and ferns grow 
at the foot of the cliff, where crumbling brown soil has gathered in heaps. 
The trees are thinner here, stopping some distance from the rocks although they 
grow into a thicker tangle further to the south, trunks closer together, leaf 
laded branches fitting together like jigsaw puzzle pieces.

A Bulging Overhang In A Cliff~
   Jutting out abruptly, the dark grey rocks of the cliff bulge out in an 
overhang, beneath which a variety of sickly looking mosses and stringy ferns 
grow. The cliff itself continues along to the east and west in a fairly 
straight line but for other areas of rock that stick out and southwards, the 
trees continue to press in. All around, the sounds of insects, birds and other 
less identifiable noises can be heard, slightly muffled by the dense 
undergrowth.

At The Mouth Of A Dark Tunnel~
   The cliffs surround this area like an enormous cupped hand, starting at the 
north and curling around to the east and then further southwards. There's a 
gap though, an uneven, ragged looking hole that yawns like an open mouth. It's 
impossible to make out what's inside, the darkness far too thick although the 
damp, dank smell is obvious closer to it. Leafy green shrubs grow right up 
against the rocks but stop before the darkness as if afraid to enter, just a 
few stray leaves curling into the inky blackness.

A Damp, Dank Tunnel~
   This tunnel doesn't open up much wider than the entrance to it, not quite 
high enough for an average sized person to stand full upright without grazing 
their head on the ragged stones. Moss and lichen and a fuzzy looking black 
mould grow all tangled together on the water slicked rocks, fighting for 
dominance so that much of the stone is coated. No light reaches here and the 
tunnel curves slightly, both openings visible at the apex of the curve.

   A great black mouth opens up in the cliffs to the east, a hole torn in the 
dark grey rock that leads into darkness. It's hard to see far into the tunnel 
itself, light obscured by the angle of the hole and the surrounding cliffs but 
the smell of damp and mould is clearly apparent close up. All around the 
opening, delicately fronded ferns cluster, settled happily in the moist ground 
around it.

An Overgrown Crevice In The Basalt Rock~
   A narrow cleft has formed in the side of the basalt mountain. While almost 
completely overgrown, it remains accessible with some care, and the deeper end 
is less dominated by the abundant jungle vegetation. The space is rather 
claustrophobic and stuffy, having collected run-off water from the mountain in 
small, shallow pools, but it seems like it would provide good shelter and a 
defensible position. Some loose soil and bunched plants are piled up at the 
end of the crevice.

At The Foot Of Craggy Mountains~
   Majestic mountains of a deep grey rock rise up out of the earth here and 
climb up into the sky to the north, a great range that stretches as far to the 
east and west as the eye can see. Greenery sprouts abruptly in some places but 
in others, the cliffs are bare but for a few dangling vines, too steep for all 
but the hardiest of plants to grow. Clustered around the base of the rocks are 
some twiggy looking bushes that lack leaves but instead have vicious looking 
spines protecting clusters of deep purple berries.

By A Dead Tree Next To A Mountain~
   Not far from the grey basalt of the mountains stands a large tree almost 
entirely enshrouded by clinging vines that spiral around its great trunk, some 
sprouting white flowers with pale green veins, others with blotchy spade shaped 
leaves. The tree is clearly dead, long strangled and now just a skeleton of 
splintering rotted wood with a few broken branches that hang awkwardly, held in 
place by the rope-like strands of still living greenery wrapped too tightly to 
let them fall completely so that they dangle like shattered limbs.

Narrow Valley Between Cliffs~
   Cliffs rise abruptly to the east and west, casting this narrow stretch of 
jungle in perpetual shade and shelter. The confined nature of the place lends 
it a claustrophobic air and makes travel particularly difficult. The trees are 
shorter and thinner while the bushes, ferns and fungi thrive in huge clusters. 
Rivulets of water occasionally trickle down the cliffs and form in small, 
temporary pools, lending additionally to the wet and humid feel of the 
rainforest.

   Fairly sheltered by the surrounding cliffs, this area is always dappled with 
shade, great patches of it that shift about as the light moves. A tumble of 
fallen rocks lie in a heap to the east, the rough angles smoothed by the small 
plants that have grown up through them and a few trees grow close to the 
cliffs, boasting silvery trunks and then great drooping branches with hundreds 
of oval shaped leaves that trail down onto the ground like living curtains.

Thick, Tangled Venusian Rainforest~
   Above, the branches of the trees lock together like a mosaic, slivers of sky 
visible like grouting between them. Fairly tightly spaced, the trees here are 
all slender trunked, supple looking things that grow straight upwards and don't 
sprout out until they're far overhead, giving brambles and bushes and other low 
lying greenery the space to grow. They seem to have done this, leaving the 
entire area extremely difficult to move through as roots and branches catch at 
anything trying to get past.

Deep In The Venusian Rainforest~
   The humidity here is tangible, almost aggressive at times as wind fails to 
penetrate the dense growth of trees and tangled bushes, the air heavy and 
still. Sound too seems muffled although the rustle of leaves and the snap of 
breaking twigs are frequently heard, along with the brief flutter of wings as 
birds make brief, hampered flights through the closely spaced trees. The floor 
is thick with fallen, rotting leaves and various mosses that seem to thrive 
despite the low light levels.

Closely Spaced Trees Deep In A Rainforest~
   Moss grows thickly on the trunks of the trees here, growth spurred on by the 
moisture in the air, the humidity far more oppressive. The trees themselves 
stand close together, tall and straight with few lower branches, the ground 
level of the jungle occupied by a variety of bushes and ferns although these 
seem to thin out further to the south as the ground becomes less solid. The 
sound of running water can be heard from that direction and a glint of it can 
be easily glimpsed across the marsh between this area and the river itself.

   Somewhere to the south, the jungle relents, giving way to an area of swampy 
marsh, the glint of the water visible through the trees. Here though, it 
stands stubbornly, trees growing close together, sometimes linked by curtains 
of trailing creeps that tie them together. Bushes cluster on the ground too, 
some with broad, glossy green leaves of a striking dark green, others with tiny 
clusters of leaves that gather on delicate stems. A few have flowers in a 
myriad of colours that erupt from the greenery without warning.

Thick Jungle By A River~
   Brown water cuts a path through the jungle here, forcing a break in the 
thickly clustered trees. It's hard to see far in the dense undergrowth, hard 
too to make any kind of progress through the vegetation that springs up, 
fiercely crowding the banks. Lush and green, a cluster of succulents with fat, 
swollen leaves gather close to the water, their startlingly vivid magenta 
flowers seeming irresistible to a number of insects who buzz around the blooms.

   The bank to the north has lapsed into the river, along with a tree that 
grows nearly parallel to the water. Its branches dip into the river here, 
shedding leaves which are then whisked away on the current, swept into 
swirling, dancing eddies. The river curls around the tree, then spins away 
westward around a bend, seeming to pick up speed a little.

   The river has barely finished exiting one bend before it throws itself into 
another, water slopping up against the banks. Great basalt cliffs rise up to 
the west, meaning this stretch of the river is darker than others despite the 
lack of large trees in the vegetation that grows on the banks. To the north, 
the river continues, flowing fairly fast now, the tug of the current meaning 
progress against it is a little harder.

   What passes for the river bank here is lined with some almost delicate 
looking grasses that boast wild, tangled seed heads of a pale green. They 
cluster close to the waters edge, thirsty, threadlike roots dangling into the 
murky brown liquid. This area seems free from any large trees although few 
weedy saplings and spiny bushes grow in the shade of the cliff that dominates 
to the southwest and cobwebby mosses drape lazily from the rocks along with 
some trailing creepers.

Moss and lichen cling to the dark grey rock, carpeting it and climbing up the 
dank, moisture soaked walls. Tumbling tresses of vines and creepers partially 
obscure the opening to the north, beyond which is a short drop to the brown, 
turgid waters of the river that runs past and opens into a wide pool to the 
west, the whisper of it as it passes clearly audible along with the murmur of 
the jungle further east.

   Basalt rocks erupt from the water to the south, craggy and moss filled but 
overhanging so that progress out that way is impossible. The rocks themselves

blotches that match the stamens of the enormous, bell shaped blooms that dangle 
down almost into the water.

waterline. They overhang slightly, making any attempts to scramble up that way 
all but impossible despite the many crags and crevices. Vines tumble down from 
above, but stop too far up to offer any kind of assistance out. The water 
curls around a bank to the west, narrowing to the north before continuing on 
its journey.

doused in shade. Travel is especially hard going, the trees crammed into the 
confined space. They're shorter than their open jungle counterparts, while 
ferns and bushes thrive in enormous bundles and fungi of all different colours 
grow on the rocks, a gathering of mustard yellow ones currently winning the 
battle for dominance. Water trickles down the cliffs and forms little puddles 
at the base of the rocks and the humidity seems to intensify.

oddly muffled when it does, leaving this area perhaps unnervingly quiet.

A Lushly Vegetated River Bank Near A Spring~
   To the south, water bubbles up from the ground in a wide pool that narrows 
and becomes a river that flows off to the west where the ground slopes down, 
the incline slight but noticeable. All around, plants and bushes have sprung 
up with some enthusiasm, clearly thriving at the water's edge. They crowd 
around it as if pushing and shoving for the best position, while insects seem 
to perform the same dance, the air often thick with winged bodies.

On The Edge Of A Squelchy Swamp~
   It's hard to say exactly where it happens, but somewhere here the ground 
becomes waterlogged and is soon ankle, then calf and then knee deep in stagnant 
water that originally flowed in from the river that's just visible through the 
trees to the south. Heavy with moss and streaked with slimy algae, the ground 
is treacherously soft, sometimes appearing solid when it's really little more 
than a bog that sucks at the feet noisily and hungrily, appetite seemingly 
insatiable.

Where A Swamp Bleeds Into A Lake~
   The brown water from the lake to the south has saturated the ground and 
turned it swampy, a wide expanse of linked, shallow pools punctuated by trees 
that rise up from them, their roots appearing sometimes like sinuous sea 
monsters. Insects buzz and hum all around and birdsong can be heard 
frequently, although glimpses of the birds themselves are few and far between, 
the many dangling branches heavily clad with leaves providing a large amount of 
cover for them to hide behind.

Knee Deep In A Squelchy Marsh~
 Knee deep water has gathered here into a kind of marsh from which slender 
trunked trees rise up, their bark turned green with algae. The smell in places 
is quite overpowering and winged insects frequently form cloudy hazes that 
hover above the surface of the brackish, clouded water. Sometimes, the 
stillness is broken by something unidentifiable that glides past out of sight, 
causing ripples that spread out across the otherwise mirror like surface. 
Southwards, the marsh merges into a lake.

A Treacherously Muddy River Bank~
   Solid ground becomes increasingly less so here, the earth swollen with water 
that seeps in from the river as it winds its way around a bend. This area is 
not so much bank as mud, sometimes knee deep in places. A number of thick, 
springy mosses seem to thrive in the sopping ground, disguising the mud and 
making it all but impossible to pick a safe, dry path through, the way seeming 
to only become boggier and harder to trudge through to the east.

A Narrow Stretch Of River~
   Snaking northwards, the cold water of the river brown from the swirling soil 
scraped from the banks which are overgrown with leafy ferns, the surrounding 
areas moist and waterlogged. The current pulls fairly strongly at times, as if 
the river has purpose and a destination in mind despite its apparently 
meandering appearance.

Marsh To The South Of A River~
   A bank of trees separates the marsh from the bend of the river that lies to 
the north, preventing any influx of fresh water. That leaves this area 
stagnant, gnarled trees pushing up through the slimy water that has gathered in 
squelchy pools. Unseen things slide through the water with sinuous bodies, a 
faint splash occasionally or the whine of insect wings breaking the relative 
quiet.

Marshy Ground Near Basalt Cliffs~
   Water bogs the ground, turning it marshy and lying on the surface in 
sometimes stagnant pools that spew flies and other winged insects at the 
slightest disturbance. Twisted, skinny trunked trees sprout from the ground, 
some distance apart so that travelling through this area is relatively easy, 
but for the looping, partly submerged roots that seem eager to clutch at 
passing feet and the arched, trailing branches that dip into the sometimes 
ankle deep water.

Marsh At The Base Of Basalt Cliffs~
   The marsh persists right up to the base of the cliffs to the east, not 
especially deep here, just squelchy. Even the more solid areas hold their own 
dangers though, the ground churned into a thick, sucking mud that sticks to 
everything. In all accessible directions, the swamp continues, growing deeper 
and wetter as it spreads.

Marshy, Swampy Ground~
   A narrow bank of earth lines the river, rimmed with trees. It drops away 
fairly sharply, the ground lapsing into areas of standing water. Insects 
gather on the surface of the water, which gathers in glistening, murky pools 
interrupted by looping tree branches and roots that poke up from the wetness. 
The swamp is generally no more than ankle deep, fairly still although sometimes 
movement stirs in the reeds that grow around the trees, causing a cloud of 
winged things to start up into the air.

At The Foot Of A Tiny Waterfall~
   The ground to the east is raised a bit, the banks squeezing a large lake 
that lies in that direction into a small waterfall which plunges down a little 
drop here. It's not an impressive sight, but the spray of water is enough to 
have washed away the soil, revealing dark grey rocks that are now covered with 
slimy blueish green algae, the fronds of it waving gently in the water. After 
swirling around a bit in a brief pool, the water tumbles into a river again, 
continuing north.

At A Narrowing In The Lake~
   The vegetation laden banks seem to squeeze the lake here, forcing it through 
a gap and over a slight drop to the west that forms a miniature waterfall where 
the water plunges down. It's not a big drop, but enough to give the flow some 
further momentum as it slips back into a narrow river that continues to wind 
its way westward through the rainforest that surrounds it in all directions.

A Still, Peaceful Lake~
   There are currents in the lake, dragging the water on its journey westward, 
but they seem to swirl around mostly to the south in a wide arch, leaving this 
area of lake still and peaceful. Deep water gives way to water no more than 
chest deep, getting increasingly more and more shallow to the north where the 
marsh stretches into the jungle. Up above, the open sky is visible, no longer 
hidden by the branches of the trees and all around, the sounds of jungle life 
can be heard.

A Placid Corner Of Lake~
   The lake shallows gently here, ebbing into the swamp lands to the north so 
that it's almost impossible to tell where lake ends and swamp begins. Trees 
grow in areas where it's not too deep, rising up out of the water with algae 
and slime coating their trunks, bent over and trailing branches. All around, 
insects and birds flit through the trees and the humidity seems to let up a 
bit, a welcome breeze coming in from the south and giving this area an airy, 
light feel.

Swampy Ground By A River~
   Sometimes knee deep, brackish water has collected here, forming a kind of 
sucking mud in some places and a squelchy swamp in others. Closer to the river 
to the south, the swamp is more watery although further inland, vegetation has 
grown and cut off some areas, forming fetid pools of stinking, stagnant water. 
Trees grow fairly far apart, hunched and bent over the swampy ground with their 
leaf laden branches dangling low like living curtains.

In The Waters Of A Bubbling Spring~
   Icy cold water gushes up from the ground here, forming a roiling, bubbling 
pool settled at the base of the eastern cliffs. Great bubbles form and then 
explode outwards, showering the surrounding area and turning the water itself 
white so that it's impossible to make out what might be beneath the surface. 
The pool lengthens to the south, then snakes around in a lazy bend and begins 
its journey westward, pressed into a river.

At The End Of A Narrow Valley~
   To the east and west, cliffs rise up. In places, water runs down from above 
and moss grows thickly. Trees grow too, crammed into the narrow valley, some 
twisted at odd angles as if to better fit into the space and dozens of 
different kinds of ferns are clustered on the ground. Southwards, the cliffs 
part a little but the darkness doesn't seem to abate much and the vegetation in 
that direction looks stunted and not right.

   Something isn't quite right in this place. The jungle darkens and takes on 
a gloomy, ominous air. The surrounding cliffs have grown taller, stealing 
almost all of the light and leaving this stretch of forest in perpetual 
darkness. The trees are stunted and weak, seemingly short-lived, and the 
softer vegetation begins to take on unhealthy tints the further ones ventures 
south and west.

Among Rotting Vegetation~
   The plants are dying here. Something is killing off the vegetation and 
leaving behind a layer of rotten organic matter among the bare, blackened 
skeletons of bushes and stunted trees. Unpleasant slime covers every surface 
and the ground is incredibly moist, giving to any pressure and sucking 
everything several inches into the swampy sludge. Little seems to live here 
save for flies and amphibians. To the west, the ground becomes a mire of 
murky, stagnant water, seemingly the source of the corruption.

   The pool to the west seems to have burst its banks at some point, flooding 
this area with knee deep water but vegetation that has since sprouted up has 
cut off the flow of new water, leaving this area stinking and stagnant. 
Decaying leaves and dying bushes rise up a little way from the black, filthy 
water, which continues to spread further to the east and south.

Where A Pool Joins A River~
   The startling cold water is calmer than it is closer to the spring to the 
north but is by no means still. Ripples constantly twist the surface of it and 
it often sucks at the banks, which are thick with vegetation, different jungle 
plants all tangled together and dangling into the water. The pool narrows to 
the west, forming a wide river that heads off in that direction, its progress 
aided by a slope in the jungle floor.

   Freezing cold water rushes westward, crashing up against the high southern 
bank that splits this area off from a dank looking swamp beyond it. The water 
seems to be gathering sediment, already a murky brown colour with bits of leaf 
and broken twig floating in it, the banks crowded with vegetation and 
overhanging trees that lazily trail leafed limbs into the water.

A Wide Lake In A Jungle~
   Cold water cuts a path through the jungle in a widening river that flows 
from east to west, given momentum by the slope of the jungle floor. It forms a 
lake here, a large stretch of water suddenly open to the sky as the trees that 
cover most of the rainforest are confined to the edges, their branches reaching 
out a little way into empty space before they give up, content to sit on the 
banks and watch the insects that skate on the surface of the lake with flimsy, 
delicate legs.

   The water here is deep and cold, brown but fairly clear. Currents beckon

sharply out of the water, possibly too steep to climb and heavily crowded with 
vegetation.

slippery looking. A few trees grow on it, making it harder to see what lies in 
that direction. Elsewhere though, the lake continues, a large, almost oval 
pool of brownish water open to the sky and rimmed by thriving greenery, the 
sounds of insects, birds and other animals frequent in the surrounding 
rainforest.

   Curving around in a sinuous line as if in mimicry of the river, the swamp 
creeps through the rainforest. It doesn't make it as far as the river, the 
bank raised and sloping, preventing its egress in that direction but it 
stretches out wetly and lazily southwards. The swamp isn't all water, more a 
collection of large puddles, no more than knee deep and split off by soggy 
areas of squelchy looking ground.

Swampy Ground In The Rainforest~
   The swamp from the north continues, firmer ground to the east kind of 
sinking into it. The going is treacherous, the swamp consisting of great 
puddles of standing water that are sometimes just a few inches deep and 
sometimes are more sizable pools, capable of swallowing a leg up to the knee. 
Insects skate on the surface of the water and algae gathers, along with strange 
clusters of jellylike beads with squirming insides.

The Edge Of Marshy Ground Near Cliffs~
   There's a brief stretch of extremely waterlogged ground that runs from the 
north to the south, but it's not deep, just a few inches of brackish water. 
Beyond that, the swamp seems to finally relent, greenery creeping back in and 
turning the ground more solid. Westward, cliffs of very dark grey rock rise 
up, angles turned smooth by the moss that grows on it, sucking in the moisture 
from the humid air.

In A Wet Fungal Fen~
   The ground here is wet and spongy, providing the perfect breeding grounds 
for a thriving culture of fungus. Growing in sizeable clusters, they range in 
size from the tip of a finger to a person's head and are generally spherical in 
shape. Their off-white skin is soft and breaks easily, exposing the beige 
flesh of the fungi. Little else grows here save for scraggly weeds and the 
occasional fern while a swamp opens the terrain to the northeast.

   Swamp stretches off in every direction here, great pools of sludgy, clouded

roots, breaking the surface of the water while the air is thick with small 
insects. Birds fly here infrequently too, their passage hindered by the 
cobwebby creepers that trail from the branches of the trees and other things 
sometimes stir, usually disappearing too quickly to be identified.

   Gently curving, this area of ground lazily surrounds the water, which begins

faint rush of a small waterfall audible from here. The shore is more of a 
bank, the drop into the brown water fairly steep. Southwards, swampy marshland 
pushes in, the trees and bushes growing right up to the water, which looks deep 
and cold from here.

a kind of shore by the lake that stands to the north. Bushes grow clustered at 
the water's edge, thick and tangled together and trees jostle for space, their 
trunks sometimes twisted as if in an attempt to find a clearer path up towards 
the sky. Ferns nestle in the roots of the trees and there's a breeze here that 
cuts in through the break in the canopy above the lake, providing some respite 
from the humidity deeper in the jungle.

nauseating odour powerful even from here. Westward, the ground seems more 
solid for a spell as the lakeshore continues, covered with thriving vegetation.

A Black Watered Swamp By A River~
   Perhaps this area was once part of the river to the north, although this is 
no longer the case. Sludgy mud has built up in a bank that separates it, 
leaving great puddles of shallow water that are sometimes up to knee deep. 
Vegetation from the surrounding trees has fallen into the water and rotted, 
turning the water a deep, oily black and few of the trees seem to still be 
living, just their hunched over forms still standing, devoid of greenery. Very 
little stirs here, the rush of water from the river seeming loud in the 
startling quiet of this area.

A Vile Swamp Near A River~
   In sharp contrast to the fresh, bubbling spring to the north, water has 
gathered here in still and now stagnant pools, now cut off from the fresh water 
by a thick ridge of earth and soil where ferns and brightly coloured flowers 
cluster. They stop abruptly though as the swamp begins though, giving way to 
hunched over trees and spiny bushes, trailing vines that hang like cobwebs into 
the black and stinking water.

   A viscous liquid that's really more sludge than water is gathered on the 
ground here in pools that are sometimes ankle deep, sometimes knee deep. The 
surface of the pools is an oily black, meaning it's next to impossible to tell 
the depth of the pools and even the few areas of more solid seeming ground suck 
at the feet, making every step an effort. Westward, the filthy swamp continues 
but seems to relent somewhat to the east.

particularly large tree appears to have succumbed and fallen.

Decomposing Stretch Of Jungle~
   Something has taken its toll on the vegetation here, causing it to die and 
rot. Sloughing trees lean precariously and limp, unhealthy underbrush lies 
flat against the ground. The stench of decomposing organics is an assault on 
the senses, only exacerbated by the extreme humidity of this place. Ominous 
croaking and buzzing can be heard all around, echoing off the cliff walls. 
Slimes and lichens cover many surfaces, leaving little place to sit or place 
things. To the north, the vegetation seems somewhat more healthy.

A Darkened, Decomposing Stretch Of Jungle~
   The vegetation here has withered, leaves blackening on the dying, shriveled 
stalks, curled around the edges. The smell is offensive, overpowering, 
catching at the back of the throat and the humidity only makes it worse. Flies 
and other winged insects buzz about, the sound amplified by the surrounding 
cliffs that are covered in sticky looking slime, lichens and raggedly moss.

By A Huge, Rotting Log~
   While the trees in this area are small and weak, one seems to once have 
prospered at their expense. Now dead and fallen, its enormous trunk lies on 
the soggy jungle floor like a dead giant, its wood now blackened with rot and 
slime. Part of it has grown hollow and the interior is coated with slippery 
lichen and fungi. Easily seven feet in diameter and about a hundred feet long, 
the great log takes up a considerable amount of space.

log~
   Seven foot wide a hundred feet long, this dead tree trunk lies intact on the 
jungle floor like a slain giant. It is almost black and covered in all manner 
of parasitic growths, from slime molds and fungi to regular weeds. It is 
hollow and can be accessed from its ragged end.

In An Eerily Silent Fen~
   Nothing seems to move here. The ground is a mire of shallow puddles 
surrounded by clusters of flimsy reeds. To the north, a belt of real swamp 
borders what appears to be a lake while to the south begins a forest of unusual 
trees. Here, however, the air is silent and there is little evidence of 
wildlife, lending the area a foreboding air.

Watery Fen Near A Lake~
   The shore of the lake evens out into a stretch of open land. The ground is 
a mire of shallow puddles surrounded by clusters of flimsy reeds. To the 
north, a belt of real swamp borders what appears to be a lake while to the 
south begins a forest of unusual trees. Little seems to move or live here, and 
the air is unusually quiet in contrast to the symphonies of the jungle.

In A Sparsely Vegetated Fen~
   The surrounding swamp eases into a stretch of less burdensome wetlands. 
Shallow pools of clear water dot the terrain, surrounded by belts of reeds and 
fungi. To the north, the waterlogged shore of a lake can be seen while to the 
south begins a forest of peculiar trees with multiple trunks. Cliffs rise up 
in the distance to the west and east, and this flat area is relatively quiet.

On The Edge Of A Swamp~
   The swamp finally subsides here, just fading out with little fanfare. Water 
seems to collect in long, crescent shaped pool but the surrounding jungle floor 
is more solid and the trees shift from those hunched over swamp denizens to the 
upright, straight trunked specimens that reign in other parts of the jungle. 
Here, the two exist side by side seemingly quite happily as the ground 
stabilises and the swamp comes to an end.

Waterlogged, Swampy Ground~
   A haze of flying insects has gathered over the surface of pools of brackish 
water that make up the swamp. Trees sprout from the marshy ground, twisted, 
hunched over things with gnarled bark and trailing branches. Most of them have 
small, oval shaped leaves of a deep, glossy green, the colours here generally 
darker than in other areas of the rainforest. The humidity is oppressive and 
the smell that rises off the stagnant water can be really quite unpleasant.

A Copse Of Wire-Like Trees~
   A dense collection of striated trees grow here, rising high above the jungle 
floor. They have textured trunks similar to taut cable, about a foot in 
thickness but very tall and straight. Their emerald green leaves hang in 
clusters from far above, none within reach, while a web of russet-colored vines 
is draped between the trunks like festooned chains. They continue to the south 
while a swamp breaks the forest scenery to the north.

Fungal Colony Under Protruding Cliffs~
   Large clusters of fungi dominate this stretch of land under the leaning 
cliffs to the west and south. Growing in the shade and shelter of the gray 
rock, they thrive seemingly unchallenged as no other vegetation can be seen in 
the area. They range in size from an inch to two feet in diameter and are 
vaguely round, coated in off-white skin that peels off easily to reveal the 
porous beige flesh underneath. The colony thins out to the north while the 
jungle takes hold again to the east.

beyond reach. The trees have no boughs below their tops and seem impossible to

tall and straight. Their emerald green leaves hang in clusters from far above, 
none within reach, while a web of russet-colored vines is draped between the

revealing the moist soil and myriad of insects that creep about before fleeing 
from any nearby movement.

Deep In A Mysterious Jungle~
   The jungle reigns in all directions, thriving like a living organism in all 
its verdant splendor. Strange sounds and bizarre plants lend it an eldritch, 
unnatural edge, as if it were taken out of a dream or a work of surreal art. 
The senses are overwhelmed by its symphony of wildlife and water, the 
overpowering organic scents and the wild, otherworldly sights. The humidity is 
stifling and the forest is perpetually wet, soaking travellers in showers of 
droplets whenever the vegetation is disturbed. Colourful insects are to be 
seen in every crevice and cranny, playing their part in this complex ecosystem.

Between Clusters Of Mutated Trees~
   This part of the jungle is home to an unusual treesort. Shaped akin to 
something like a cupped hand with its splayed fingers rooted in the ground, 
they rise ten to twenty feet from the jungle floor and gather in a small knot 
of gnarled wood. Lacking canopies of their own, they instead bear loads of 
draping vines and other parasitic plants that droop down through the half dozen 
irregular trunks of these trees. This continues all around save for the north 
where the terrain opens up into a marshy fen.

   The moist fen to the north melds into forest again, becoming a jungle of 
strange trees. They have no one trunks but rather about half a dozen limbs 
that rise from the jungle floor and gather ten to twenty feet above the ground. 
The trees have no other branches and no leaves of their own, but vines and 
other parasitic plants cover their upper reaches all the same. Looking not 
unlike a hand with all its fingers thrust into the soil, these gazebo-like 
trees provide some shelter.

Overgrown Remains Of A Rockfall~
   A shower of rocks must once have tumbled from the cliffs above, scattering 
throughout the area as a layer of boulders and head-sized stones. The thick, 
stubborn jungle vegetation has since reclaimed the area, though they have left 
the visible remains of the rockfall as small, moss-covered hills amidst the 
underbrush. Less trees grow here, but still one finds the peculiar spidery 
species that rise from the jungle floor like natural gazebos. To the south, 
the cliffs provide an area of perpetual shade.

   The plants are dying here. Something is killing off the vegetation and 
leaving behind a layer of rotten organic matter among the bare, blackened 
skeletons of bushes and stunted trees. Unpleasant slime covers every surface 
and the ground is incredibly moist, giving to any pressure and sucking 
everything several inches into the swampy sludge. Little seems to live here 
save for flies and amphibians. To the north lies the enormous trunk of a dead 
tree.

A Blackened, Festering Jungle~
   Blackened and rotting vegetation hangs from the limbs of trees like the skin 
from the ribs of a decomposing animal. The branches themselves are rotting 
too, mould growing on the damp, flaking wood that's turned soft by the vast 
amounts of moisture in the air. Underfoot, slime coats the ground and black 
patches sometimes turn out to be clouds of insects that explode up into the air 
when disturbed.

Wading Through A Stagnant Pond~
   A pond of murky, stagnant water sits here, almost invisible from the outside 
thanks to its border of tall, thick reeds. It is not particularly deep, but 
the water is dark and unpleasant, like a decomposing organic soup. There is no 
way around it as it takes up the entire span of jungle between the sheer cliff 
faces to either side. South of here, the narrow valley continues while the 
forest to the north is evidently in a poor state.

the lack of moss on the stones indicates that the rockfall must have been 
relatively recent. The austere cliffs ascend upwards to the southwest while a 
dying stretch of the jungle festers in all other directions.

vines that dominates this area. Festooned across the landscape in great, 
tangled coils, they form webs and curtains of tough, fibrous tendrils. They 
are difficult to see through and even harder to travel among, and their density 
lends the place an intensely claustrophobic effect. The humidity is no less 
overpowering here and the vines dictate the terrain as far as one can see.

with stubby palm-like leaves sprouting from their tops. At the height of an 
average man, they crowd the forest and their sharp-edged leaves snag at any who 
walk too close. The trees have a thick, knobbly textured bark with a spicy 
scent, sticky in places where the sap has seeped forth. The underbrush is 
typical for the jungle, cosisting of all manner of smaller bushes and ferns.

ground, crushing the trees and underbrush where it landed. About twenty feet 
in diameter and shaped like a slightly flattened egg, the craggy stone is now 
covered by a layer of spongy moss. The jungle continues in all directions,

clustered on the rocks along with mosses and a kind of dark green slime that 
seems more prevalent to the north from where the stench of decaying vegetation 
wafts. The air hangs heavy, humid and thick, stifling as the surrounding 
cliffs trap it in.

small, temporary pools, lending additionally to the wet and humid feel of the 
rainforest.

gather in clusters with ferns and bushes growing in the spaces between their 
roots, trampled paths intersecting the greenery.

forming an impassable border in the landscape. The jungle is silent as the 
grave, seemingly devoid of animal life, and the air smells strange whenever a 
breeze shifts it in from the south.Water trickles down the cliff in places, and 
it has little black particles in it where it gathers in puddles on the ground.

In The Dim, Lifeless Jungle~
   The absence of life strikes like a palpable presence in its own right, 
contrasting starkly with the norms of the otherwise so lush and vibrant jungle. 
The grim, grey-trunked trees form dense canopies of nearly opaque dun-colored 
crowns, blocking most of the light and giving the place an enclosed feeling. 
The rock wall to the north continues west and east while the forest to the 
south grows even darker and strangely hazy.

In The Dark, Silent Jungle~
   It is quiet here under the cliffs. For whatever reason, wildlife shuns this 
part of the forest, leaving it as silent as it is dark. The austere gray trees 
continue to the south, and though the underbrush is sparse, visibility in that 
direction is strangely hazy even when taking the darkness of the area into 
account. It is less humid here than in the rest of the jungle, almost chilly 
in the perpetual shadows.

Into The Dark Jungle~
   The jungle takes on a gloomy, inhospitable air here. Dreary, grey-trunked 
trees stand in austere rows, their dense, dun-colored crowns forming a layer of 
near-opaque canopy thirty feet above. The sounds and sights of life become 
increasingly rare further to the southeast where the forest grows ever darker. 
Cliffs rise to the east, forming a harsh wall of craggy rock in that direction.

Towards Dim, Ominous Depths Of Jungle~
   In contrast to the lush, vine-laden rainforest to the north, the landscape 
here grows quiet and dark. Dreary, grey-trunked trees grow here with equally 
bland and uniformly dun-colored crowns, forming a dense and near-opaque canopy. 
There are signs of life in the underbrush and among the treetops where the 
occasional croak or rustle is heard, but it grows ever fainter to the southeast 
where the jungle becomes darker and more threatening.

In A Quiet, Dismal Jungle~
   The forest becomes increasingly dim and unpleasant, consisting almost 
exclusively of boring rows of gray trees with coarse, dun-colored canopies. 
They continue all the way up to the mountainous cliffs that form an irregular 
wall to the southeast, allowing very little light to filter down to the jungle 
floor. Few insects can be seen or heard, and no larger animals appear to live 
in the vicinity.

Through A Foreboding Jungle~
   This dark, harsh jungle stands out in stark contrast to the rest of the lush 
and vibrant rainforest. There is something thoroughly unpleasant in the area, 
almost like a natural warning, and the wildlife appears to have taken the hint 
as it is wholly absent. Rows of stern, ugly trees rise in solemn rows, their 
drab canopies blocking out most light, and the forest becomes increasingly hazy 
to the east where some kind of mist or smoke obscures the terrain.

In A Gloomy, Spore-Filled Jungle~
   Something unpleasant is in the air. Little black particles float everywhere 
like the ashfall of a volcanic eruption, and the trees are covered with a thin 
layer of these organic spores. They lend a haze to the already dark jungle, 
hindering visibility in all directions. The underbrush is sparse and bleak, 
consisting of limp plants and the occasional spotted vine.

Among Foul, Black-Barked Trees~
   The trees here look similar to the uniformly gray ones that grow in the area 
save for their black bark. Upon closer inspection, however, it is not the bark 
that is black but a layer of something that covers it. The substance is a 
matte black and looks like particles of mold, though the trees seem unaffected. 
The air smells peculiar, like something akin to burning rubber and garlic.

A Shady Corner Of Rainforest Near Cliffs~
   Hemmed in by tall cliffs, the atmosphere here is stifling, the humidity 
tangible. The cliffs themselves are thick with moss and ferns grow at the base 
of them, rooted into the moist, rich earth. Trailing creepers dangle down from 
the cliffs and a few small trees with thin, weedy trunks grow, the vegetation 
seeming to thick again westward.

   The underbrush has been flattened in places, forming a clear path from east 
to west where bushes and grasses have been trampled. The cliffs rise all 
around, sheltering the area but rendering it dark and oppressive at the same 
time. The sound of birds and insects that otherwise fills the jungle seems 
rather less persistent here, and the shadowy stretch of forest between these 
cliffs has a foreboding air.

the humid air.

In The Depths Of A Spore-Infested Jungle~
   The air here is hazy with tiny black spores that float freely between the

tasteless when breathed, it is impossible to avoid them. Nothing moves or 
makes a sound, suggesting a complete absence of wildlife.

   These dark dephs of jungle are incredibly unpleasant, assaulting the senses 
with a barrage of unnatural offenses. The air is laden with black spores that 
smell like a burning laboratory, and the unnerving sight of these floating 
particles is almost surreal, like a slow-motion black snowfall. It is quiet 
here, too quiet compared to the rest of the jungle where moisture and wildlife 
weaves its omnipresent symphony. Nothing seems to live here.

   A pond of water expands from the base of the cliff here, forming a small, 
shallow lake in the natural corner of the rock wall. The water has a murky, 
yellowish tint, and foamy orange residue has gathered all along the edge in 
long parallel lines. The powerful stench of sulphur wafts from the water, and 
little grows in the vicinity. To the north and east, the dark forest extends 
grimly, and tiny black spores hang in the air between the trees.

   The hazy, spore-filled air is worst here, and the source becomes visible: a 
large, slimy mound of glossy black fungus, shaped not unlike a great cowpatty 
some five feet wide and as high as a tall man. It is slumped into the corner 
of the cliff to the southeast as if defecated down the side of the rock. 
Occasionally, this mound of disgusting fungus pulses obscenely and expels a 
puff of tiny spores into the air. Nothing grows nearby, nor is there any trace 
of animals or insects.

   It's hard to see far here, the motion of the water stirring up mud and gunk 
from the frond lined river bed, whipping it into swirling eddies as the 
current. Bits of stick and twig and leaves float too, the water much colder 
and darker than on the surface where the sun can reach it, contradictory 
currents seeming to pull in several different directions at once.

bottom from sight, although it's hard to see much at all in the depths. 
Sometimes light filters in from above and the branches throw strange, shifting 
shadows on the surface of the water that penetrate here.

Up Some Natural Basalt Steps~
   Great steps of basalt have formed here, making progress up into the 
mountains relatively easy although plants have grown in the cracks and any 
missteps send showers of scattered soil and small stones tumbling down. This 
relatively flat area looks over the jungle, still rather lower than the canopy 
although northwards, it climbs into the sky. To the east, a clearing in the 
jungle can be seen, a number of prefab containers placed around in a fenced off 
area.

An Outcropping Of Basalt Cliffs~
   This section of rock juts out, cutting its way into the jungle below. The 
surface is uneven but easy enough to walk on, the cliff dropping off sharply on 
all sides. East, a manmade clearing stands although progress in that direction 
is made impossible by a metal chainlink fence bolted directly into the stone. 
The drop to the south is very steep, but a quick and dangerous scramble could 
probably be made to the jungle floor below.

   A ridge of rock rises up to the east and continues northwards, creating a 
kind of wall that blocks off passage in that direction. While vines and small 
plants grow all around, there don't seem to be any trees here and the 
cloud-filled sky is clearly visible overhead, the range of mountains rising up 
into it. The stretch from east to west as far as the eye can see, great grey 
masses of stone scattered with green where vegetation has taken hold, not 
massively tall although the climb looks very steep in places.

branches waver this way, drooping down so that they're close enough to touch as 
they tickle the rock face with their leaves. North and west, the rocks become 
too steep to climb, but form a relatively flat area here where a few stubborn 
bushes grow from cracks in the stone.

ledges, but the rocks here seem firm enough to climb without danger. The 
mountains loom northwards, stretching right across from the west and cupping 
around a camp in the jungle as they continue their way eastward.

humidity of the jungle considerably lifted without the canopy to trap the air 
and overhead is a vast expanse of cloud filled sky.

in the dark grey rock that leads into down into darkness. It's hard to see far 
into the tunnel itself, light obscured by the angle of the hole and the 
surrounding cliffs but the smell of damp and mould is clearly apparent close 
up. All around the opening, delicately fronded ferns cluster, settled happily 
in the moist ground around it.

like a tear in the rock, probably leading down into the mountain itself, 
judging by the angle of it. It's quiet here, but for the murmur of insects and 
the odd call of a bird, the vegetation here still pervading although it hasn't 
taken over in quite the same way that it has a hold on the jungle floor.

A Sloping Tunnel Through The Mountains~
   The ground underfoot is slick stone turned slippery in places by the moss 
that grows here. The smell of damp is heavy in the air and a chill pervades. 
The ceiling is high enough to allow even the tallest of people to stand 
upright, squeezing into a narrow crack that finally disappears to nothingness.

Further Down A Sloping Tunnel~
   The tunnel floor here climbs fairly steeply up to the west, the top of it 
not even visible in the darkness. Eastward, the floor flattens out a bit and 
the claustrophobically narrow tunnel seems to widen. Here though, it's cramped 
and unpleasant, the stones damp and cold with a chill in the air and a strong 
smell of damp.

At The Bottom Of A Sloping Tunnel~
   To the west, the rocky, slightly uneven ground climbs steadily and steeply 
upwards into the darkness. Southwards lies what looks like a well, a large, 
dark pool of water. It's cold here and damp, although the conditions are 
apparently perfect for the white, ghostlike fungi that are clustered in various 
cracks and crevices among springy, silvery clumps of moss.

An Underground Pool Of Water~
   The water here is ice cold, clear although the bottom is out of sight, just 
inky blackness visible. Up ahead, the rocks arch over in an uneven ceiling, 
mosses and lichens growing in the many crevices while the whole area has a damp 
smell and an almost aggressive chill that pervades. Northwards, a ledge 
provides access to another tunnel through the rock that seems dry.

A Split In A Mountain Tunnel~
   The tunnel opens up here into a cave with branches off in three directions. 
The passageway north seems the widest and tallest, the western tunnel fairly 
narrow. East lies a narrow gap, walls so close together so that it's 
claustrophobically tight in that direction. The tunnel walls themselves are 
damp and cold, silvery moss mottling the rock like mould.

A Narrowing Passage Through The Mountains~
   Although the tunnel to the south seems fairly wide, it turns an awkward, 
jutting out corner here and narrows considerably to the east. It looks like it 
would be impossible to walk more than single file that way and some areas look 
like a tight squeeze as the cold, damp rock bulges out unevenly. The roof of 
the cave is high overhead, this tunnel tall but rather thin.

A Claustrophobically Narrow Mountain Tunnel~
   It becomes necessary to actively squeeze through the tunnel here, the gap an 
awkward shape that narrows at the bottom, meaning progress is slow and 
difficult. The angular shape of the basalt doesn't help, creating odd shapes 
and bulges that make travelling this way very difficult. Westward, the going 
looks a little easier, but northwards, the gap overhead becomes to narrow and 
it looks like the only way through will be to crawl.

   This part of the tunnel is too low to stand, the basalt rocks bowing 
overhead. The ground is uneven, making crawling difficult and uncomfortable, 
the rocks icy to the touch, cold enough to numb fingers. Southwards, the 
tunnel seems to open up a bit but the cramped tunnel continues northwards, 
squeezing through the rock.

   The low roof of the tunnel slopes up to the east and the rock seems to widen 
again there, while the narrow passage to the north continues. It's still 
impossible to stand here, this ragged tunnel only just big enough for one 
person to crawl through at a time in most places. Angular rocks bulge out at 
all angles, making progress slow and a little treacherous while a deep and 
intensive chill pervades.

A Dead End By A Cave In~
   The tunnel here once continued to the north, but a tumble of loose rocks 
block the way now. They seem to be wedged tightly together and the cracks only 
reveal more rocks beyond and a few areas of inky blackness. Southwards, the 
narrow tunnel stretches out, winding its way through the cold grey rock. A 
cold breeze occasionally stirs here, whispering and echoing off the hard stone 
although it's impossible to work out where it's coming from.

   The narrow passage to the west widens and the roof arches up in a slope to 
this wide tunnel that is fairly cavernous in size. A few huge columns of 
basalt support the craggy, uneven ceiling in places and the floor is uneven and 
dangerous, the rocks slippery underfoot due to the faint sheen of water that 
seems to glisten on every surface. There's a cold breeze coming from 
somewhere, although no source can be found.

   Craggy, uneven rocks make up the walls, floor and ceiling of this cavern, 
which narrows abruptly to the east as the passage makes a sharp turn and 
continues southwards. The temperature is low here, the chill deep and 
pervasive, the air clear and cool with just the a faint hint of damp to it 
every now and then, probably from the few mosses which lie in various cracks 
and crevices.

disappearing into darkness where the crack narrows again. From somewhere, a 
cool breeze murmurs every now and then.

the dark grey basalt angular and almost icy to the touch, a thin sheen of 
moisture sometimes clinging to it. Underfoot, the floor is uneven and few 
things grow here apart from the occasional hints of stubborn moss or lichen, 
although even those are few and far between.

looking, hexagonal shaped columns of rock. To the north, it continues in a 
narrow passageway that seems to twist and turn as it makes its way through the 
stone. Several jagged looking rocks poke out from one wall but don't impede 
progress across the uneven floor too much.

   The tunnels from the north opens up here into this vast, impressive cavern 
with a huge arched ceiling and hundreds of hexagonal columns of basalt that 
rise up out of the floor. Some are tall enough to meet the roof, other stop 
short, the effect quite breathtaking. Sound echoes here, taking on a musical 
timbre as it bounces off the many hard surfaces, sibilant and sonorous. 
Southwards, the uneven floor slopes downwards, a pool of black, very still 
water gathered in that corner.

The Corner Of A Wide Cavern~
   After a narrow gap to the west, the tunnel opens up into this large, 
impressive cavern with a naturally arched roof. Hexagonal columns of basalt 
line the room, eerily architectural after the uneven walls of the tunnels. 
They stretch up like the pipes of a giant organ, sometimes merging into the 
ceiling, sometimes stopping short. No natural light reaches this part of the 
cave and it's very cold and damp, a thin sheen of water gathered on the surface 
of the rock.

   Hexagonal columns of basalt line the walls, jutting up out of the uneven 
floor to meet with the great arched ceiling. They do funny things with the 
sounds, giving everything a musical quality as every noise from a footstep to 
an indrawn breath reverberates off the hard stone. To the east, the floor dips 
down, subsiding into a still and glistening pool of black looking water.

   Roughly circular in shape, this pool occupies a corner of the cavern. 
Surrounding on all sides by hexagonal columns, the water is almost mirror-like 
until disturbed, the lack of natural light making it appear pitch black. It is 
freezing, shockingly cold, seeming to descend for quite some way, although it's 
hard to tell from here exactly how deep it goes.

   The cavern to the west narrows here to this small, naturally formed alcove. 
The hexagonal columns here all stop at around waist height, resulting in an 
uneven platform before the more usual, angular rocks appear again and the 
alcove ends in a dead end. It's very cold and nothing grows here but for a few 
faint traces of moss that cling to the rocks close to the ceiling.

necessary to stoop, although north of here, the ceiling is higher and the 
passageway seems to widen again. It's very cold and a sense of damp hangs over 
the area, although there doesn't seem to be anything growing, not even mosses

the other opening up to the west. There's no natural light at all here and the 
air is very still, giving the area an almost sterile feel. Nothing seems to 
grow here and the cold is heavy and all encompassing, the dark grey stone 
seeming to actively leech heat from the body, although they always remain icy 
to the touch.

   This underground cavern is huge, the ceiling arching far overhead, crags in 
it sometimes far too deep to be seen. It stretches out in all directions but 
for the south, where it narrows into a tunnel that leads in that direction. 
All around is the dark grey basalt of the mountains, sometimes pressed up into 
ragged rocks, always angular, giving this place an impressive feel.

   It's hard to tell how deep this place is, but it feels like it's miles below 
the surface, this huge, arching cavern a far cry from the lush green 
rainforest. It's cold, every surface hard grey basalt. In this corner, a 
series of enormous looking rocks stand, four of them in a not quite straight 
line, each successive rock slightly smaller than the last so that they play odd 
tricks with the eyes, twisting perspective a little. South and east, the 
cavern continues.

The Corner Of A Cavern~
   The ground dips down steeply here into a giant crevice, the bottom of it 
just the right width to catch a foot and turn an ankle, although it should be 
possible to avoid it with care. Overhead, the great basalt rocks stretch, 
supported only by the walls although there's an air of solidity to this massive 
cave, like some kind of natural cathedral. It's solemn and dark and very cold, 
and the feeling of being surrounded by rock with the weight of mountains 
pressing down is difficult to ignore.

A Smooth Ledge In A Cavern~
   Unlike the rest of the cavern where the floor is uneven, the ground here is 
almost smooth, slightly slanted. It slopes down from the east in a great slab 
of rock that rejoins the floor to the west, creating a kind of ledge in some 
areas, although the slope is gradual, not leaving any sharp drops. The walls 
here collect moisture, which trickles through the cracks, turning the already 
dark grey rock almost black in places.

sprout at random from between rocks, seeming quite happy here.

collected around them. It should be possible to climb down that way, but the 
way west looks much safer, down a rocky but fairly gentle slope. All around, 
the mountains continue to rise, not especially tall although they stretch out 
for a long way east and west.

By A Precariously Rooted Tree~
   A tree grows here, against all odds, loosely rooted in the rocky soil that 
has gathered in a depression here. Its roots are exposed in several places, 
gnarled and brown, like questing fingers, a weedy specimen compared to the 
trees that sprout down at the foot of the mountains to the south. Overhead, 
the Venusian clouds blanket the sky, filling it as far as the eye can see.

A Rocky Ledge In The Mountains~
   This fairly narrow ledge runs across from the east and west, stable enough 
although it's quite high here. The rocks to the south jut up a bit, creating a 
rim that makes falling difficult and northwards, a rock face provides access to 
even greater heights, although several loose looking rocks will probably make 
climbing that way difficult. A few grasses grow here, springing up out of 
small cracks, unlikely crevices, mostly dry and brown looking although a couple 
of greener ferns seem happier.

A Rocky Corner In The Mountains~
   Grey rocks block off the way west and north, but they fall away to the 
southeast. The view in that direction is beautiful, a stretch of rocky, steep 
mountain full of dangerous scrambles and crumbling ledges before the great, 
sprawling expanse of rainforest begins. The top of the canopy is visible from 
here, great rolling fields of green, sometimes a hint of brown interrupting. 
Surrounding the forest, the basalt mountains stretch out, running in a line 
from the east to west.

A Precariously High Ledge~
   This is about the highest point that can be accessed from here. The 
mountain does continue to climb, but an overhang makes further progress upwards 
impossible and the cliffs to the east and west are also too steep to climb. 
Southwards is a sharp drop to the narrow ledge below, the climb fairly 
treacherous looking with several loose rocks that could prove to be loose.

A Small Cave Behind A Waterfall~
   A blanket of water cascades down over the open mouth of the cave, turning 
the view blurry while the almost metallic rush of it echoes off the damp, 
glistening walls. Water splashes up everywhere, turning the dark stone slick 
and wet while moss and algae cling to the surfaces. It's perhaps surprisingly 
cold here, an icy chill to the water, which forms an uneven but very deep pool 
that disappears into blackness below.

impossible to see the end of the tunnel from here.

   This tunnel through the rock is unpleasantly narrow and claustrophobic, 
barely wide enough for a person to swim through. It stretches east and west, 
both directions filled with freezing cold but crystal clear water, surrounded 
on all other sides by jagged rocks of such a dark grey that they appear almost 
black, no natural light reaching this area from any direction.

An Icy Underground Well~
   The water here has gathered in a deep well that bores down into the stone, 
freezing cold. Darkness looms beneath, imposing and it's hard to tell exactly 
how deep the pool goes, but the bottom is well out of easy reach. To the east 
lies the lip of the pool, a little ledge that juts out over the water and 
beyond that is an uneven underground tunnel.

uneven but easily wide enough for several people to swim through into the 
gaping darkness beyond.

   The walls of this flooded tunnel are angular, sometimes jagged rock. 
They're really not that close together, the tunnel fairly wide but there's a 
claustrophobic feeling that pervades the area as the freezing cold water 
presses in from every direction and darkness looms both ahead and behind, 
making it impossible to see where the tunnel ends.

in, although another tunnel continues northwards, entirely filled with icy cold 
water that is clear, although the lack of natural light means that the tunnels 
themselves are entirely unlit, dark and forbidding.

   The space inside the hollow log is roomy enough for most to stand, but only 
along the center as the rounded sides are slippery with lichen and slimy rot. 
Fungi grow in patches on every surface, and the occasional plant sprouts up 
from the soil through holes in the crumbling floor. About twenty feet of the 
log's length is hollow and spacious enough to move in.

   The hole forms a narrow tunnel into the basalt, barely three feet wide. It

Eight feet in, the space widens into a small cave about the size of a toilet 
cubicle. It is just possible to stand, and if both arms are stretched out to 
either side, one can touch the opposing walls. The place smells strongly of 
earth and moisture, and insects thrive on the rough, craggy walls.

Balancing On A Log Bridge~
   A tree has fallen across the gap between the forested area to the north and 
a bare cliff ledge to the south, spanning it neatly. It is possible to walk 
right across, but it is no easy task. Below, the river runs sinuously along 
its path, carving a blue ribbon through the green carpet of the jungle. One 
could jump into the water from here, but it is a little too far for a 
comfortable dive.

   There is a narrow ledge here, a flat lip off the sheer cliff wall. It is 
only just wide enough to walk upon, but it seems to widen to the west where it 
cuts into the side of the cliff. To the north is the opposite ledge, forested 
and dense, with a fallen tree spanning the gap to allow precarious passage. To 
the east, the ledge ends and the jungle continues some distance below. 
Directly underneath is a curving river, lazily snaking its way through the 
terrain.

   The ledge widens here, but only enough for two people to walk side by side. 
To the north is the opposing rise, its forested terrain running parallel with 
this one. East of here, the ledge narrows but can be departed via a log that 
bridges the gap above the river. It widens underneath this ledge, looking 
deeper and darker for a stretch so that it might even be possible to jump into 
it without risking serious injury. A small path branches off to the south, 
cutting into the cliff before rising steeply.

Along A Steep Path~
   The rugged path winds upwards in a tiresome climb up the cliff. It is dusty

some distance ahead into a wide open vista. While not very long, the path is 
so steep that it can only just be walked without the use of hands, and it is

On A High Vista Overlooking The Jungle~
   This is quite a sight. Up here, most of the jungle is visible. It spreads 
west to east, connected by a narrow belt of forest right below this cliff. 
Directly beneath the vista, a sinuous river runs parallel to it while to the 
north beyond it looms a stern basaltic mountain. To the southeast, the 
rainfrest darkens somewhat and takes on a less hospitable look while to the 
west it opens up into a waterfall that tumbles over the edge of the cliffs 
there, a level below this plateau. It is majestic to behold, a pristine and 
thriving jungle covering the entire range of vision. Far below, the river 
widens into a deeper spot. It seems feasible to jump into it from here, but it 
is quite a fall and could be dangerous.

   This cave bores into the side of the rock like a cavity in a tooth, forming 
a small and uninteresting hole. The recent presence of animals is obvious as 
the senses are alerted to their leavings -- the place stinks of waste and the 
rocky floor is littered with dried turds. In the opposite end of the cave, 
something seems to have burrowed further into the ground. To the east, the 
rock opens up to the jungle and the promise of fresh air.

   Climbing the tree is hardw ork, but relatively simple thanks to the many

   This ledge is far from flat, consisting of a lip of craggy, jagged rock 
floor that juts from the side of the cliff. It is rather far from the ground, 
certainly thirty feet and sloping upwards in the only direction available. 
From here, the vast field of treetops is visible just a few feet below. A thin 
line of trees encircles this particular cliff, and a perilous path winds its 
way clockwise around it up here. Off to the side, the thick limbs of a tall 
tree reach almost to the ledge.

   There is not much room to maneuver on this path. It snakes its way along

feet above the jungle floor. A squat mountain sits to the north while an 
enormous one looms to the east, blocking any view of what may lie beyond. The 
ledge continues southward along the curvature of the cliff where it becomes 
even steeper.

   It is arduous work to clibm this uneven path, often requiring the use of

climber with the pecular sight of a narrow stretch of jungle to the south. 
That part of the forest seems less than hale, looking rather as if much of it 
is decomposing. The cliff seems to reach a flat plateau further up, promising 
an end to the tiresome climb.

Majestic Vista High Above The Rainforest~
   This is a marvelous view. One can see leagues in all directions save for 
the east where a humongous mountain looms just across a narrow forested valley. 
To the north, a smaller and less forbidding mountain sits while to the south is 
a stretch of rotting, putrid jungle swamp. Southwest of here, the rainforest 
darkens until it disappears into an area behind another cliff wall. Far to the 
west, the river emerges from the swamp and snakes its way through the gulch 
between an ancient volcano and a forested rise north of it. The keensighted 
might spot a log spanning the gap, but it seems to be hidden behind a wall of 
tangled brambles, concealing it from the raised belt of jungle that it connects 
with. The canopies stretch out more than a hundred feet below, looking more 
like a lawn from here.

Venusian soil been exposed but several tree trunks are still visible, sawn off 
a little way above the roots while the debris from the cleared trees is 
scattered around, twigs, sawdust and shriveled up vegetation gathered at the 
base of the cliff.
