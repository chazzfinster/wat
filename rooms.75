Before the Massive Gate to The Hyperion Platform~
   To the south lies the foundation of Hyperion Platform, an enormous structure 
of impregnable metal from which rises the reflective dome of the closed city. 
It is a grim and forbidding sight, a dominant centerpiece to the haphazard 
collection of slums and shanty towns that surrounds it on all sides. The 
throngs of the market are thinner here, most seeming to subconsciously avoid 
the area's menacing atmosphere. Barely visible under a layer of moondust and 
another layer of graffiti is the faint outline of a massive hexagonal gate the 
likeness of a blast-door, but it has clearly not been opened in ages. It is 
eight yards in diameter with no window or visible opening mechanism from the 
outside.

Outside Bjork's Boozer~
   Interspersed unevenly around the marketplace is an occasional vendor, loudly 
hawking their wares to any that would listen, voices cut through and drowned 
out by other voices - more vendors, louder. The loudest of these is rewarded 
with more customers, most of them probably more annoyed than anything else, but 
wasting their time there, regardless. Trash is littered everywhere over the 
dirt road, kicked by the crowded traffic or otherwise pounded firmly into the 
dirt, providing a meager pavement. 
   The building to the south is fairly lively, with all sorts of raucous noise 
and people spilling out, adding to the bustling traffic.

By a Gate in the Corner of the Market~
   The piecemeal walls of the market meet here to form a corner. The din is 
less pressing in this end as no hawkers have set up shop so close to the gate, 
but there is a steady stream of denizens entering and leaving the market. 
Armed guards are posted by the gate, giving everyone a scrutinizing look before 
allowing them entry. Trash and old plastic cups have been stomped into the 
ground in such amounts as to nearly form a pavement of hard-packed garbage.
   You must #6CALL GATEGUARD#8 to leave the market.

Hooker's Plaza~
   This small section of the market is less crowded with vendors and stalls, 
giving way instead to a plaza where the prostitutes of the town linger. Some 
present themselves brazenly to market-goers, others stand meekly in the 
background, but their purpose is clear. Denizens with children give this area 
a wide berth, but groups of adolescents are often seen keenly "browsing" the 
"merchandise." 
   To the south, the many-layered market wall rises about twelve feet up, 
consisting of all manner of metal sheets and plastic boards hammered together 
into a crude barrier.

Sparsely Crowded Area by a Gate~
   Compared to the rest of the market, not much goes on here by the 
south-western market gate. Guards stand idly by, opening the passageway for 
people who want in or out of the market. There are few hawkers in the 
vicinity, but the relative peace of this corner makes it a common meeting spot 
for people, and there is indeed a collection of individuals spread about the 
area looking around expectantly. 
   To the west, a reinforced metal door with a spray-painted #3"GOLD"#8 is the 
only alternative to the patchwork market wall. 
   You must #6CALL GATEGUARD#8 to leave the market.

Along the Edge of the Market~
   Traffic hurries through the markets, people with their heads bowed, nearly 
all staring at the ground and minding their own business. At odd intervals 
somebody stands away from the throng, surveying the wares of a haggard vendor. 
To the north the Perimeter looms, as impenetrable as it is forboding, casting a 
constant shadow for many yards. The ground might once have been paved with 
asphalt - but that was a long time ago. Now it is naught but dirt and trash, 
forced into shape by thousands of passing feet, all of it a dull grey. A pair 
of massive double doors lead to a warehouse to the west, through which a heavy 
flow of traffic moves.

At a Sewer Grate in the Market~
   This section of the market is more sparsely populated, with most denizens 
passing hurriedly by. The reason is obvious: through a grate in the ground is 
the entrance to the sewers from which the unmistakeable stench of such a place 
periodically drifts up into this area. However, people are seen entering or 
leaving the sewers once in a while, often carrying filth-encrusted bags or 
armfuls of scavenged junk.

The Open Hawker's Market~
   The total absence of structures denotes this as the Hawker's Market, an area 
for people carrying bundles, baskets, display cases or merely handfuls of wares 
for sale. Persistently pestering anyone who gets too close, these hawkers let 
no one pass by without informing them loudly and repeatedly of just what they 
are selling. Strangely enough, they all seem to be selling more or less the 
same things. 
   South of here is the gate to Hyperion, a massive vault-like entryway that 
has not been opened at any point in Rust's history. The southern market wall 
gives way to the city's sheer metal foundation, above which the gigantic dome 
of the Hyperion Platform rises sternly.

Outside the Public Clinic~
   The market extends in all directions, ever busy and crowded with denizens. 
Here, rising out of it like a small island, is the public clinic of Rust. The 
occasional patient is seen coming or going - or, for an unlucky few, carried - 
through the entrance to the squat, rectangular building. Spray-painted on the 
front door is an unsuccesful attempt at a Caduceus, and next to it a red cross.

Along the Edge of the Market~
   To the east, a twelve foot wall has been built of out irregular pieces of 
sheet metal, corrugated plastic, and other boards of suitable material. This 
barrier borders the entire market, broken only by the gates and a few doorways 
into shops and warehouses situated along the edge of the market. The wall is 
not quite uniform in height, but close enough, and it bears evidence of years 
upon years of diligent repair. The buzz of the market is ever-present all 
around, a chaotic symphony of hawking and bartering and the general hub-bub of 
business. 
   East of here, a large doorway leads into some industrial hall or other, and 
heavy machinery can be seen within.

Before the East Market Gate~
   The patchwork market wall dips a little in height to make way for a gate. 
Armed men are posted here, the unnoficial enforcers of the Rust market 
who keep this a neutral ground and ensure that known murderers are not allowed 
entry. Though no merchants have set up just here, the noise of their presence 
is still overpowering from all around, as is the constant drone of conversation 
and movement from the hundreds of denizens milling about the market.

In the Busy, Crowded Market~
   Traffic throngs through the market as crowds of people rush along, most of 
them staring at the ground, minding their own business. The insistent calls of 
vendors fill the air, and the occasional customer stops to survey the wares on 
sale. To the north, the perimeter looms, impenetrable and foreboding, its dark 
shadow crossing the marketplace when the sun is low. The ground might once 
have been paved with asphalt, but that was a long time ago. Now it is nothing 
but dirt and trash, beaten down by thousands of passing feet. 
   The ring of beaten metal pulses in from the north while the market is 
quieter to the west where the Shades fill the center of the area. To the 
south, the ominous Hyperion Platform looms.

Center of the Market, Outside the "Shades"~
   The center of the market is a cluster of shanties and miniature houses, some 
rising to three cramped storeys that each seem barely high enough to stand 
upright in. Shacks and hovels sit crammed together, forming a village of its 
own that blocks out the traffic of the market but for a couple of narrow 
entrances into the dark interior of this sub-district. Clusters of electrical 
cables snake their way around the sides of the hovels and droop overhead in its 
claustrophobically narrow passageways, and although it is situated smack in the 
middle of the market, it nevertheless manages to seem secluded in there.

The Food Market~
   The trash blanketing this area is constantly kicked about underfoot, a 
moderate sized crowd of Rust's residents clustered about a series of 
ramshackle stores in the Market, buying and selling various smallgoods such as 
utensils, pots, clothes, and hides. The sour stench of garbage still pervades 
the marketplace, but it is of secondary importance to the cries, squawks and 
shouts of the hawkers that operate their stalls here. 
   To the south, the gleaming dome of Hyperion rises like a gigantic, 
half-buried crystal ball, dominating the landscape.

Before the West Market Gate~
   Light filters through dozens of bullet holes in the scrap metal wall to the

market, and a few trash cans have been placed nearby. The ground is 
hard-packed dirt with patches of equally hard-packed garbage. There are more 
guards here than at the other market gates, but they let people in and out all 
the same.

Stalls and Carts Along the Market's Edge~
   In the shade of the market wall is a long line of stalls and carts, each 
with its vendor and browsing customers. The cacophony of competing shouts and 
insistent haggling all but rules out normal conversation, though the occasional 
lull in the barrage of sound allows speech and the use of radios even here. 
The market spreads all around save for the wall to the east, and the rhythmic 
ringing of hammers on metal sounds constantly from the forges to the west. 
   Through a large doorway to the east is a machinery hall, and from within 
wafts the heavy stench of organic matter and spoiling meat.

The Forges in the Market (needs that prog from 55279)~
   The hustle and bustle diminishes here, as most Rusters stick to the 
perimeter of the marketplace, crowding near walls and down the occasional 
off-shoot alleyway. Instead of letting this free space go to waste, a series 
of forges, lathes, bellows and benches have been set up, a vibrant hub of local 
industry producing new weapons and wares from materials scavenged from the 
wastes. The trash on the ground is slightly less compacted, and collects in 
potholes and around low, deteriorating concrete stumps. Even in the relative 
calm, the murmur of the crowd is a constant drone, often punctuated by the 
hammering or quenching of metal.

The Market Auction (needs auction stuff)~
   The loud and varied vendors of the rest of the market are absent here in 
favor of the Rust auction. Taking place on a slightly raised platform of 
concrete slabs, an auctioneer periodically displays some object or other and 
belts out his machinegun-paced routines to the interest and amazement of 
onlooking denizens. Though it is clear that few have come to actually purchase 
anything, it serves as a source of entertainment to the downtrodden proletariat 
of the settlement. 
   To the south, the peculiar district known as the Shades takes up the entire 
center of the market, consisting of hundreds of tiny, crammed-together hovels 
and sheds for society's poorest.

Amidst Dozens of Market Stalls~
   Winched between the perimeter to the north and all manners of houses and 
shanties to the other cardinal directions, the marketplace stretches across, 
perfectly flat but for the stands of vendors, racked with all manner of things 
one might buy. People stop by these, or just pass them on by - the decisions 
of a few do nothing to change the decisions of the many, as the traffic 
continues at a near-constant basis, thick, hurried, and quiet. 
   The urgent shouting of an auctioneer filters in from the east, standing out 
agains the rest of the market's wall of sound.

Through a Maze of Shacks and Stalls~
   This is clearly a center for the more permanent enterprises of the market, a 
considerable number of shacks and immobile stalls situated here, often so close 
together as to form a maze of tiny alleyways. Signs are painted on some of the 
doors, more often with a drawing of some object than with actual writing and 
some of the shacks look big enough to suggest that their owners might be living 
in the back. To the west, a large doorway leads into a sizeable hall with some 
huge processing machinery inside. Smoke wafts from a hole in the roof, oozing 
into the market whenever the wind turns.

   Here in the northeastern corner of the market is the Vendor's Corner, a
prime spot for selling and buying crafted goods. The throngs are especially 
thick here, milling and jostling about in such masses that passing through is 
nearly impossible.  Far to the south, the mountainous ome of the Hyperion
Platform governs the horizon, taking up the entire view above the market wall.
   The occasional lit sign hangs from the power cables that criss-cross 
overhead, one of which invites denizens to #D"V#Ei#Ds#Ei#Dt #Et#Dh#Ee #DH#ea#Dp#Ep#Dy #EC#Dl#Ea#Dm."#8

Market's Edge Crowded with Merchants~
   A great variety of street merchants crowd the length of the market's edge, 
barraging passers-by with shouted advertisement and offers. Any denizen who 
makes the mistake of stopping is immediately approached and solicited for a 
purchase, often rather aggressively, and some are seen shoving the more 
persistent hawkers away. Nearer the center of the market is a perimeter of 
more permanent businesses situated in small shacks and enclosed stalls, and 
further yet is the small, cramped slum village known as the Shades. 
   Beyond that, the massive silhouette of Hyperion Platform dominates the 
landscape, towering over everything like a mountain.

Outside the Northern Gatehouse~
   A layer of trash has been trodden into the ground all around, forming a 
pavement of sorts in the area outside the gatehouse. Though traffic in and out 
of Rust is infrequent, the occasional group can be seen preparing to leave or 
returning from the wasteland with freshly slain beasts (or comrades) in tow. 
In all other directions, the vibrant dealings of the market run their course, 
filling the area with noise and smoke. The wall to the north is thicker than 
the rest of the market's barrier, consisting of actual concrete slabs rather 
than mere sheet metal and plastic boards. 
   The rapid-fire shouting of an auctioneer is a constant presence to the 
south, and a crowd if curious denizens is gathered there.

Hyperion, the closed city that Rust encircles like the belt of a planet.

Outside a Large Warehouse~
   The trash blanketing this street rustles as people walk between the dingy 
concrete buildings of the town and the high perimeter to the north. The center 
of the road is more rash filled than the sides, nearly ankle deep with filth. 
This thick stew of garbage forces people to step higher, crushing whatever 
their feet hit on the down-step further into the ground, creating an ever 
present rustle-crunch - background noise to an already noisy area. 
   West of here, the patchy market wall opens up into a large warehouse.

End of the Slums Before a Gate~
   The gate to the marketplace stands here, occasionally allowing people in and 
out. Dirty people loiter about the area looking pretty miserable and some 
begging. The gate is decorated with incomprehensible graffiti and crude 
spray-painted pictures. Looking eastward the street gets dirtier and more 
decrepit as it goes along. The sounds of murmuring voices of the locals and a 
dull roar of the marketplace overtakes the area, so does the smell of the poor. 
   You must #6CALL GATEGUARD#8 to enter the market.

A Shoddy Intersection Along a Road~
   This intersection of road is pretty well traveled by the local populace, 
though strewn with what used to be vehicles and collapsed buildings spilling 
into the street from the north. The road appears to have continued north a 
little longer but is now completely covered in what used to be part of city. 
What is not covered in debris of the past has either huddled slummers or human 
excrement. The smell here is atrocious and it just gets worse as one goes 
eastward.

A Decrepit Street Passing an Alley~
   This road is barely a road at all, cracked apart and just a line of crumbled 
rocks. Often there are groups of young toughs that hang around the entrance of 
the northern alley. The southern end of the road have a few surprisingly 
intact buildings lining the way, at least the walls. Everything here is 
unlivable as the roofs are collapsed in, standing as a clue to what life was 
like. Spotted along the sides of those buildings are the poor trying to use 
them as some sort of shelter.

A Quiet Piece of Street~
   This street is relatively untouched, for the slums. The road is a 
collection of rocks of various sizes, though most of the surrounding debris has 
manage to stay off the path. To the south there's a parking lot of some kind 
of large one story building or at least what used to be. Looking to the east 
is a lone standing building amongst the rubble.

An Old Roofless Building~
   This building is surprising empty on the inside, some trash and scrap about 
but nothing more then a small mess. If one is to look up they would see the 
sky out of the roof of this three story small building. Large enough to 
comfortably house around a half a dozen people it usually is occupied by some 
sort of slummer. This house is nothing but a shell, four walls with a door and 
empty windows.

A Dark Dead End~
   This dead end is pretty bleak, various makeshift tents spotting the dark. 
It doesn't look like this was a dead end in the past but time has made it that 
way. This part of the slums make the rest look clean, the people staying here 
having very little other choice. It is very obviously the main depository of 
human waste in this part of the city.

Between Rundown Homes~
   The street here is pretty clear of debris but still in horrible shape. The 
homes on either side of the street have collapsed into what used to be their 
front yards in a pile of useless garbage. Some slummers have made their homes 
amongst what's left, huddled in the cracks and crevices for shelter. To the 
northeast a large but short building can be seen, the largest and most intact 
in the slums.

In Front of a Dilapidated Store~
   The street stops here and forks off in two different directions. To the 
north a dilapidated shop sits, the only thing still standing is the front wall. 
The letters 'S' and 'H still adorn the spot over the empty door frame, but 
there is a lot of letters missing in between and after. Looking west the road 
continues just a little, to the east the slums continue.

A Bare, Eroded Parking Lot~
   The road to the north veers into an expansive parking lot. Spreading 
southwards like a miniature wasteland, the cracking asphalt extends a good two 
or three hundred yards. Large sections of the surface is missing or riddled 
with holes, and the corpses of a few ancient vehicles can be seen scattered 
about the area. Further to the south, the enormous dome of Hyperion rises like 
a mountain.

A Parking Garage Ravaged by Fire~
   This seems to have once been a parking garage, but fire has completely 
destroyed it sometime in the past. There is no roof over the building and only 
two of the blackened concrete walls remain, providing nothing of use save for a 
convenient canvas for layer upon layer of graffiti. The parking lot is 
bordered to the east by the backs of some densely-packed hovels.

few power cables droop overhead, leading from the market to a nearby building.

   Long, jagged cracks zig-zag throughout the asphalt of this end of the 
parking lot. The heat has caused the surface to bulge up in places, leaving 
the ground rippling almost like an ocean. To the east, the back of a concrete 
building bars passage. The parking lot continues in all other directions, 
dotted with the occasional rusted barrel or the husk of a vehicle.

lends a desolate air to the bleak site. The view to the south is dominated by 
the enormous gleaming dome of Hyperion rising solemnly from the landscape.

   The asphalt is in slightly better shape on this stretch of the lot, leading 
someone to have set it up as a ball court. Two pairs of old, rusted-through 
barrels make up the opposing goals while a few faded and irregularly perforated 
lines of paint denote the borders and center of the field. A row of ancient, 
mangled benches line one side of the field, some clearly appropriated from 
elsewhere, while the wall to the west is covered in all manner of vulgar 
graffiti.

A path leads towards the latter, running under the shadow of an old billboard 
with the faded letters #3P RKING ', TO 8#8. Graffiti covers every vertical 
surface of the area, and generations of garbage have accumulated in holes and 
crevices all around.

perpetually litters the area.

through there, leading into the slums in that direction. Gravel and chunks of 
dislodged asphalt crunches underfoot.

Winding Street Near a Parking Lot~
   This street carves its way through the area, bending and turning through the 
old, faltering buildings and the newer but equally squalid shanties of the 
area. Directly to the southwest, just behind a few ruins, is the enormous 
structure of Hyperion which rises from the center of Rust like a mountain. It 
dominates the view in that direction, looming over the settlement like a stoic 
giant, 
   North of here the street expands into a parking lot while to the south it 
extends through a battle-torn area.

Winding Street by Bullet-Pockmarked Buildings~
   This stretch of the street is bordered on the west side by the foot of the 
Hyperion Platform, an immense structure of sheer metal topped with a gigantic 
biodome. Some armed struggle has clearly taken place here as the buildings on 
the other side of the street are absolutely riddled with the small telltale 
craters of gunfire. The metal base of Hyperion does not appear to have 
suffered a scratch, but everything else in the area has been completely 
peppered with bullets, turning it into rubble and ruins. 
   The street continues northward where it is somewhat less ravaged, and east 
of here it widens into the main throughfare that encircles the enormous dome 
that dominates the western view.

road continues like this in both directions until it curves out of sight behind 
the far reaches of the elusive city. 
   Nobody lives along this stretch of the throughfare. The glass dome is the 
only companion on this stretch of the road that surrounds, and rows of empty 
ruins bar passage to the south.

On A Road Near Some Hovels~
   This road runs evenly alongside the massive foundation of Hyperion, a 
staggeringly huge metal platform with a mountainous glass dome on top. The 
road continues like this in both directions until it curves out of sight behind 
the far reaches of the elusive city. 
   Hovels and small buildings become more frequent to the west as the circular 
throughfare passes through a shanty village.

In an Abandoned Building~
   This building has just enough left of its outer structure to remain upright. 
Large gaps have been torn in its walls and the middle of the interior is a pile 
of rubble almost five foot high, taking up most of the floor space. Light 
filters in through the many holes and the gaping doorway, but there is a room 
further inside where darkness prevails, and a staircase just barely intact 
enough to walk upon which leads upstairs.

   This road runs evenly alongside the massive foundation of Hyperion, a 
staggeringly huge metal platform with a mountainous glass dome on top. The 
road continues like this in both directions until it curves out of sight behind 
the far reaches of the elusive city. 
   A considerable firefight has taken place here at one time or another, 
leaving the surrounding constructs full of bullet-holes. Life goes on, 
however, and little hovels run parallel with the road until an adjacent street 
opens up to the south.

A Street Leading to the Dome~
   This street meanders through the slums, cutting a path between rows of 
shanties on both sides. The occasional real building rises from amongst the 
hovels, though most are in such disrepair as to be uninhabitable. To the 
north, the view is dominated by the enormous, reflective globe of Hyperion's 
biodome. To the south, the street continues for a distance before expanding 
into an open lot.

Meeting of Streets at an Open Lot~
   Two streets meet here, crossing at a right angle. On the south end of the 
crossing is an open lot that spreads out from the streets like oil leaking from 
a pipe. Trash cans, signposts, rubble and other features common to Rust's 
landscape are strewn about the place, and far to the north is the omnipresent 
sight of the great dome of Hyperion. 
   A few noisy people seem to be gathered down in the corner of the open aarea, 
and east of here the street runs through a large hole in a fence.

By a Fence with a Gaping Hole~
   Large chunks of concrete run along the sides of the street here, serving as 
caution from the random showers originating from the crumbling buildings above. 
Derelict buildings line the northern half of the street, almost all abandoned 
save a few that remain somewhat intact, though the southern half of the street 
provides a stak contrast in atmosphere as all that can be seen is the vast sea 
of shanty homes filling the area. Day or night, there is little to no traffic 
here though violence or other, domestic sounds can be heard, drifting in from 
nearby. To the west a chain-link fence spans the street, but a giant hole in 
the center renders it useless.

On a Street Through the Slums~
   Little remains of the buildings that once lined this street. Instead, rows 
and haphazard clusters of shantise have sprung up, forming a little village of 
sorts through which the street runs its course. The sounds and sights of 
poverty-stricken life are evident all around, and though there are usually a 
few denizens outside, they tend to keep to themselves.

Street Intersection by a Shanty Village~
   Shanties spread out in all directions, providing squalid abodes for the 
hundreds of denizens who call this area home. Two streets intersect here, one 
running east to west while a smaller one branches off to the south where it 
snakes its way through the shanty village. Poverty and depravation makes 
itself evident to all senses here, but the locals carry on with a certain 
doggedness.

Pathway Through a Shanty Village~
   Destitution is palpable in this district, painted on the face of every 
bypasser and on every shanty that this pathway meanders past. It snakes its 
way vaguely north and south with many a twist and turn, its surface no more 
than dry, hard-packed moonsoil. 
   South of here, the path ends at the wall of a dilapidated building, but it 
branches left and right into thin alleys.

A T-Cross of Alleys~
   A high scrap-metal wall brings an end to the path from the north and marks 
the border of this shanty village, barring any further passage south. The 
ruins of other buildings continue west and east, all collapsed and looted. 
   West of here is a dead end while the path to the east continues for a 
distance before making a turn.

Cul-de-sac in the Slums~
   The alley comes to a blunt stop here, bordered on one side by the crumbling 
walls of ancient buildings and on the other by a row of shacks and shanties. 
Everything here is gray, dirty, dusty and destitute, the recipe for most of 
Rust's outer slums. Bits of graffiti cover some of the upright surfaces, but 
nothing very heartfelt.

Winding Path Through the Slums~
   This path winds its way through the sea of slums like a crack in the 
pavement, something it incidentally has plenty of. Shanties and small, rickety 
buildings line the passage on either side, blocking most of the view save for 
the top of a gigantic biodome some distance away to the north. Little stirs 
here, and the few denizens who venture outside do so sparingly and with visible 
apprehension. 
   The path continues to the west where it crosses with an adjacent alley, and 
to the east is a forest of hovels and shelters through which only the narrowest 
of passageways exists.

Surrounded By Shanties~
   There are shanties all around. There is not so much a path between them as 
simply the occasional gap that one can sidle through with care. Many of the 
hovels are so small that their inhabitants cannot stand upright in them, and 
some are little more than lean-tos with open fronts. Others are sizeable 
enough to possibly have two rooms, but that is the height of luxury in this 
densely-packed shanty village. A pathway branches off to the west while a 
small space opens up north of here.

shared back yard to a number of shanty-homes. It also seems to serve as trash 
disposal as piles and bags of garbage have been left here to fester, causing 
quite a stink. Nothing else is here, not even graffiti, and there is no way 
out save to squeeze back in between the hovels to the south.

Long, Straight Street through Slums~
   There is nothing terribly remarkable about this street. It cuts through the 
slims, running right past shanties and dilapidate buildings on both sides, and 
parts of the street are littered with debris and trash. A few cables droop 
across the way overhead, out of each. West of here, a thicker collection of 
shanties marks one of Rust's many little outer villages, and to the east the 
street makes a left turn.

   The street from the west comes to an abrupt end here, culminating with the 
solitary wall of what was once a larger concrete building. Off to the side of 
the street, a pathway curves northward into an alley that snakes further into 
the slums. South of here is a sea of shacks and shanties clustered so closely 
together that passage in that direction is impossible.

Between Destitute Hovels~
   Squalor prevails all around, ground into the very fabric of existence in 
this part of the settlement. Miserable hovels, some of which do not even have 
four walls, are littered throughout the area. It is quiet and fairly desolate 
with little evidence of habitation, but the hints of residents can be found 
here and there in stray sounds or piles of fresh garbage. There is barely a 
street through this area, really more of a simple gap between the rickety 
buildings.

the west is the main throughfare that encircles Hyperion, the giant closed city

the asphalt and no buildings have collapsed into the street. It still has the 
usual Rust decor of old, dilapidated buildings on either side, but the area is 
more barren than squalid compared to the rest of the slums. 
   West of here, the street melds with the long road that encircles Hyperion, 
the elusive city whose gleaming dome is visible above the rooftops of the 
settlement.

decorates several crumbling walls, the colors now faded and dingy, though some 
of the lines are bold and sweeping. The ground nearby has clearly been torn up 
multiple times by an unknown force, then filled with rubble and garbage. 
Surprisingly enough, the area doesn't smell too bad.

uninhabitable now, their ashy, metal shells ravaged by fire. Large chunks of 
asphalt are missing from the road, making the ground uneven, and a thick layer 
of trash is compacted underfoot. To the west, the street narrows into a mere 
alley that twists its way between two collapsed buildings.

piles of rubble. Outside the ruin is a large, mostly empty yard, though some 
sort of outdoors establishment has been erected to the southeast.

north where streets depart in several directions. Further that way is the 
massive silhouette of Hyperion, the gigantic biodome that dominates the center 
of Rust. 
   East of here, in the opposite corner, some locals have set up an outdoors 
bar. It reeks of urine from that direction.

The Neutral Ground~
   The corner of this sizeable yard has been turned into an outdoors bar. 
Bricks are stacked up to form a makeshift counter, on top of which is a long 
board of plastic, and the sparse clientele sits on mismatched chairs and stools 
in the vicinity. Behind the bar is the door to a dilapidated building, the 
only one in the surrounding area that looks intact enough to live in. The 
stench of piss is as strong as the stench of trash and booze here, coming from 
the nearby walls that serve as convenience for this shoddy establishment.

Gently Curving Road Around Hyperion~
   This road runs evenly alongside the massive foundation of Hyperion, a 
staggeringly huge metal platform with a mountainous glass dome on top. The 
road continues like this in both directions until it curves out of sight behind 
the far reaches of the elusive city. 
   The domed giant seems particularly oppressive along this stretch of the 
road, its presence enhanced by the absence of other noteworthy features in the 
vicinity.

the far reaches of the elusive city. 
   One of Rust's many old, abandoned buildings have collapsed onto the road 
here, leaving it covered in rubble and concrete debris.

   This road runs evenly alongside the massive foundation of Hyperion, a 
staggeringly huge metal platform with a mountainous glass dome on top. The 
road continues like this in both directions until it curves out of sight behind 
the far reaches of the elusive city. 
   The backs of some buildings to the west form an impassible barrier in that 
direction while the sheer metal foundation of the domed city is an ever-present 
companion to the other side of the road.

the far reaches of the elusive city. 
   To the west yawns the entrance to what appears to be a parking garage. 
Light filters into the building through countless broken windows, but it 
remains gloomy and unwelcoming when viewed from outside.

Long, Shanty-Lined Road Around Hyperion~
   This road runs evenly alongside the massive foundation of Hyperion, a 
staggeringly huge metal platform with a mountainous glass dome on top. The 
road continues like this in both directions until it curves out of sight behind 
the far reaches of the elusive city. 
   All along the side of the road are shanties and lean-tos, the dwellings of 
local denizens. A building blocks the way to the north while the main 
throughfare continues to encircle the gigantic dome that dominates the center 
of Rust.

Amongst the Shanties and Hovels of the Shades~
This is the Shades, the dense slum that takes up the center
of Rust's market. Here reside the weakest, the poorest,
or those who will not risk living in the shanty-towns outside
the market. All around are rows upon rows - and layers, stacked
two or three storeys high in many places - of small, squalid
homes. Most consist of little more than four hammered-together
walls of sheet metal or plastic boards, and many are scarcely
tall enough to stand upright in. Extremely narrow alleys
bisect the area, and a network of electric cables and water
pipes criss-cross overhead. The slum is cast in perpetual
gloom, allowing very little light to enter between the blocks
of piecemeal shanties. However, a few armed folk patrol the
place, seemingly stationed here to keep the peace and ensure
that these dingy homes remain somewhat secure.

Narrowing Road Near the Market~
   The road encircling Hyperion narrows here as shanties increase in density, 
forming a large slum-town as the throughfare approaches Rust's market. Cables 
droop overhead, feeding the more privileged of the neighbourhood's buildings 
with precious electricity. Old, dented barrels line the sides of the road, as 
does more and more trash the closer one gets to denser dwellings.

Slum Street Near the Main Throughfare~
   Little more than an alleyway, this street snakes along between buildings and 
makeshift hovels. A waterline bridges the passageway overhead and out of 
reach, and the traffic increases the closer one gets to the market that lies 
north-east of here. 
   In a building off the side of the street is a shop, a rare sight outside the 
security of Rust's market. A sign above the door just bears the name 
"Bayle's."

Hovel-Filled Area West of the Market~
   A sea of hovels and piecemeal structures fill this area. There is only a 
single narrow street through the shanties and shacks that make up this 
slum-town. Traffic is nevertheless high so near to the market, keeping the 
street busy at most times. Cords and pipes criss-cross overhead, supplying the 
better-off denizens and feeding the few real buildings in the area.

An Alleyway Near the Market~
   A slim alley winds its way between the domed city's blockish foundation and 
the pitted concrete wall of an adjacent building, funnelling traffic to and 
from the market through an inconsiderately small passageway. The sounds and 
scents of the market become stronger to the east, and the gate comes into sight 
as one approaches. To the west, an expansive shanty-town spreads out over the 
area.

Market Gate Surrounded by Walls~
   There is little space to loiter here, and barely even enough for the traffic 
from the market gate to the north. Confined between the metal platform of 
Hyperion's foundation to the south, the market wall to the east and some 
concrete warehouse to the north, this place is rather clautrophobic even 
without the presence of market-goers. A web of cords and cables form something 
like a canopy overhead, adding to the closed-in sensation of this passageway.

Street Through an Old Industrial Area~
   The buildings here are large, old and now dilapidated factories with chipped 
and bullet-marked concrete walls and shattered or boarded up windows. The tops 
of many walls are topped with barbed wire or have shards of glass and broken 
bottle tops embedded in cement in a crude but effective attempt at security. 
Overhead, bundles of coloured but now grimy wire hang, festooning themselves 
across the trash-filled streets.

T-Cross by a Billboard~
   Underfoot, the asphalt of the road is heavily pock-marked, refuse collecting 
in the cracks. It stretches out to the east and west and also branches north, 
past an enormous curved billboard that obscures the rundown buildings behind 
it. The plexiglass screen that once shielded the advert has long since been 
removed and the rusted frame now holds only a confused mess of inexpert 
graffiti.

Street Past the Skeleton of a Huge Vehicle~
   The street here is wide but over half of it is taken up by the rusted 
remains of some kind of construction vehicle, perhaps a crane. Anything useful 
has been stripped from the machine, leaving only the rusted metal bones 
presumably too heavy to be easily carried away for scrap. It has large tracks 
but one of them has sunk down into a crack in the road and is twisted and 
warped, making it utterly immovable.

The End of a Narrow Street~
   Cramped between buildings runs this narrow street, made narrower still by 
the overhanging upper floor of one metal clad structure. It's dirty, grime and 
dust coating everything, refuse and discarded junk cluttered all over the 
floor. Southwards, the street converges with another, seeming to open out 
again.

   This section of street is much narrower than the street to the north, 
squeezed between the walls of the polycrete and metal structures that stand on 
either side, obscuring the light. Wires and cables droop down and the roof 
overhangs in places, leaving this area feeling somewhat claustrophobic. It 
continues on southwards, meeting another road a little further on.

Under a Billboard on a Long Street~
   To the south, the street branches off, narrowing as it snakes off between 
the looming, grey faces of the buildings. It continues east and west too, 
beneath the watchful gaze of a woman pictured on a billboard that towers high 
above the street. The picture is pitted with age, several strips of it missing 
so that the slogan that accompanied it is now unintelligible, but the woman's 
now faded brown eyes remain, unobscured by decay or graffiti.

south are crumbling, the metal wire that laces through the structure visible in 
places although it remains standing. Another section of the wall is blackened 
as if from some explosion but east and west, the street continues and another 
opens up further north.

against the walls of the buildings and caught in the wire fencing that 
separates the street from a yard filled with the remains of rusted machines and 
vehicles. Eastward, the walls of the market can just be seen and to the west, 
the road stretches out through rundown, rickety structures.

   Scrap metal forms a barrier to the east, a makeshift wall with a rusted gate 
that can be opened by the guards who linger nearby. Bullet holes mark the 
metal, flashes of the market behind visible through the ragged gaps. The 
asphalt peters out or is covered by dirt which has been stamped down into a 
hard layer by many feet as people pass through frequently in both directions.

A Long, Sign-Filled Street~
   On the north side of the street, a series of metal signs on poles bristle 
from the ground like unnatural trees. Some are bent, all are scratched and 
defaced, just the odd letter or a flash of colour from some now obscured 
picture still visible. All around, the buildings of this industrial sector 
sprawl in various states of decay, the gaps between many of the larger, older 
buildings filled with more makeshift structures hastily constructed.

T-Cross of Streets in an Industrial Area~
   The street opens up a bit here and the buildings grow taller although no 
more attractive, functional and plain, their purposes opaque. One squat but 
imposing building on the northern side of the street stands behind a tall, 
spiked metal fence, its bars too close set to see anything but a peek of the 
cluttered junk yard behind. Opposite stands a dank looking workshop with a 
slanted roof, its windows set high off the ground although not high enough to 
avoid the graffiti that marks the front of the building.

   Northwards the streets converge but this is just an unremarkable stretch of 
road. Buildings loom up on either side of it, grey and drab and forbidding 
with small, mean windows, most of them barred or simply boarded up. Cables and 
wiring protrudes from holes in the sides of many of the often squalid looking 
structures, some with flat roofs, other with more makeshift covers of 
corrugated metal or plastic.

seemingly abandoned building looms, in something of a state of collapse while 
the street itself continues to stretch out to the north and south, lined with 
clusters of squat, bleak grey buildings that are utilitarian and ugly.

Short Pathway From a Parking Lot~
   This short stretch of space snakes its way between buildings on either side, 
carving a narrow pathway east to west. In the latter direction, a linked fence 
once barred the way but has since been dealt a gaping hole large enough for 
anyone to duck through. East of here, the path widens into a proper street 
that continues in that direction as far as one can see.

once a carpet has long since been scavenged, leaving the floor a rough and 
stained concrete surface. A stairwell leads further up into the building while 
the entryway is perpetually gaping, its doors having disappeared long ago.

On a Bleak, Run-Down Street~
   This street has seen better days. The ancient asphalt is broken up in many 
places, pocked with little craters and cracks. Bent and rusted metal skeletons 
line the pavement, some from lampposts or signs and others from the mounts of 
benches or trash cans. To the east, more organized locals have clearly made an 
effort out of making the place somewhat presentable. 
   The street continues east to west for some distance, remaining straight and 
relatively free of obstacles.

Widening Street Off an Alley~
   Few people wander this stretch of street, faces downcast as they pick their 
way along the broken, uneven pavement. The hulks of metal buildings slowly 
dissolve on each side of the street, eaten away by rust and disuse. It widens 
to the west, cutting into a section of gang turf in that direction.

On a Street in the Slums~
   This fairly typical street cuts a path through the outer slums of Rust. 
Little traffic passes through here, but denizens are present to the west where 
the area has clearly been claimed by organized locals. Graffiti covers the 
walls of the squalid, crumbling buildings, but there are less shanties and more 
actual structures in in the area than to the east.

Barrel-Filled Street Off the Throughfare~
   Clusters of rusted, hole-riddled alion barrels have been left out here, some 
with smouldering fires inside. There are shanties and small, dilapidated 
buildings on either side of the street, but further west the area seems to 
contain more houses and real buildings. East of here is the long, curving road 
along the perimeter of Hyperion.

On a Street Festooned with Power Cables~
   The ruins of concrete and metal buildings line this stretch street. A few 
makeshift shanties rise from the toppled foundations, constructed of materials 
salvaged from the now-skeletal remains. Excepting a few patches of worn 
asphalt, the street underfoot is trash and gravel, from which a handful of 
dusty weeds struggles for life. The street continues east and west, and 
overhead is a dense web of power cables that droop across the street from one 
building to another. Further west, the street becomes more populated and seems 
to be the territory of organized locals.

Outside the Happy Clam~
   In the darkness of the looming perimeter wall to the west, this busy 
side-street ends. Many of the businesses here seem abandoned or incredibly 
ancient, their walls repaired with rusting sheets of metal or simply left as 
is, showing more buildings and darkened alleys beyond. Cat-calls and whistling 
can be heard alongside the pounding of music that beats out from the bar to the 
north and a handful of people always mill about its entrance where faded 
posters have been hung under the bar's electric sign, every single one of them 
showing off a voluptuous woman, or a pair of women, in little to no clothing.

A Shabby, Abandoned Building~
   Constructed from chrion girders and polycrete, this building is just a shell 
with only a few bits of the internal walls remaining. Old wiring pokes out 
from walls and dangles hazardously from the ceiling and the frame of a 
staircase lurks in one corner although the upper floor is missing, the flat, 
hole-filled roof visible high above. Assorted junk has gathered in the corners 
and a strong smell of urine lingers unpleasantly, a telltale dark stain marking 
the chipped polycrete floor.

The Art of War, before a Greenhouse~
   The buildings here are built right up against the perimeter wall, small, 
mean constructions of polycrete, metal and polyprop sheets. Most seem dark, 
dingy and forbidding, many of the plexiglass windows covered with metal 
shutters, bars or wire mesh in an attempt at security. To the south side of 
the road, a greenhouse has been built on a rare patch of relatively open space, 
plexiglass hazy with condensation.

The Art of War~
   This road continues to stretch from east to west, the asphalt full of pock 
marks, in a bad state of repair. The buildings are the same, polycrete shells 
cracked and graffitied, metal panels battered and rusting badly. The perimeter 
wall is visible behind them to the north and another, less solid wall made of a 
series of loose looking metal planks runs the length of the south side of the 
road.

The Double Barrel~
   Dreary and uninteresting, this section of street is much like the last, the 
squalor not as severe as in the more slummy areas of Rust with electric cables 
strung in bundles overhead although it's still filthy. Traffic is frequent 
here, people trudging along this route in both directions and at all times of 
day and night while the sounds of life press in from all around.

The Double Barrel~
   A few shabby looking buildings are clustered on the northern side of the 
street, a few unsteady looking creations tucked made entirely of sheets of 
metal sandwiched between a few grimy polycrete buildings. Between them, the 
plexiglass structure of a greenhouse can be made out although it's inaccessible 
from here, the way barred by wire and metal fences. East and west, the street 
continues.

The Double Barrel~
   At the head of a t-junction, this road runs east to west. Along the 
northern wall stand a series of squat, ugly polycrete buildings with flat roofs 
and small plexiglass windows set high above the ground. The walls seems to 
make up the back of the building as there are no doors and the large expanse of 
polycrete has been used as the canvas for a graffitied mural of the double 
barrel of a gun. While faded and marked with bullet holes, the painting is 
skillfully done, exaggerated perspective leading the eye straight down the 
shaft of the gun.

The Eastern End of The Double Barrel~
   This long street finishes here, bending around in a sharp hook to the north 
where the cracked asphalt continues on for a distance before it meets the 
perimeter wall. Looking southwards from here, the great dome of the Hyperion 
Platform is visible, rising up above the ill-constructed, unkempt buildings 
that make up Rust. Graffiti is frequent although almost completely wordless, 
aphasic message communicated through usually crude pictures.

Approaching a T-Junction~
   North of here the road meets another in a t-junction, a mural of the double 
barrel of a shotgun clearly visible in the distance. The asphalt underfoot is 
cracked and patchy and the buildings about are dingy, shabby and in a state of 
disrepair, most only a few floors high and with a distinctly makeshift feel, 
sheets of corrugated metal or plastic often jumbled together to form rickety 
looking lean-tos that crowd up against the other buildings to create extra 
space.

   A tall wall stands to the eastern side of this relatively wide street, a 
badly constructed slab of crumbling, pock-marked polycrete splashed with a 
layer of red paint. The arched shape of a large, shabby looking hangar is 
visible some distance behind it while on the other side of the road, more 
rundown buildings loom behind tumbledown wire fences.

A Courtyard Surrounded by Ramshackle Buildings~
   A wide expanse of polycrete here forms a courtyard that was probably 
intended to once form a pleasant outlook for the buildings that encircle it. 
Time has not been kind, however and now the sagging, rundown buildings look out 
over what is effectively a dumping ground, broken furniture, machinery and less 
savoury objects bundled into haphazard piles through which a few paths lead to 
the entrances to the buildings.

   This ground floor room is clearly abandoned, dank and musty with spotted 
mould growing thickly on the polycrete walls. Anything of value has been 
ripped out including all the lights, just a few wires protruding from the 
ceiling where they used to be. Now, this space is just a dumping ground for 
all kinds of junk which has accumulated, occasional rustling noises audible 
from deep within them.

Amidst Piles of Trash~
   All around this area, assorted trash is heaped up. Here, however, some 
effort has been made to clear it, leaving this unexpected little area of 
scuffed polycrete. A fire pit of sorts has been fashioned from a series of 
bricks piled into a circle and a salvaged piece of curved metal forms a half 
moon shape that could be used as seating.

A Graffiti-Stricken Stairwell~
   A polycrete staircase leads upwards from this sheltered area of this grimy 
housing block, connecting to the walkway above. It has been liberally covered 
in a riot of graffiti, most of it obscene, the odd letter visible but no 
complete words. There's a pervasive and persistent smell of urine and other 
more unpleasant scents, while an odd echo warps every footfall and other sound 
made in the area, giving everything a vaguely eerie feel.

enough to use, though their condition warrants some uncertainty. Doorways lead 
to small apartments on all sides, though half of the actual doors are missing. 
It sells faintly of urine and vomit in here.

   Generations of graffiti cover the concrete walls of the stairwell here, 
ranging from vulgar comments to vibrant artwork and gang signs. More 
apartments lie to all sides of the landing, but it is impossible to climb 
further up as the stairs there have collapsed long ago. The entrances to four 
small apartments are at a landing here, but some of the doors are missing.

Not much remains of the apartment's furnishings, and the paneless window shows 
a bleak view of the slums to the north.

sledgehammer or something, leaving a ragged, gaping hole to the world outside 
where the reflective dome of Hyperion takes up the entire view.

   Seemingly a frequent choice of shelter for the homeless denizens of the 
area, this room shows signs of recent habitation. Garbage, mattresses and 
other leavings remain, and the walls are decorated by a chaotic array of 
graffiti. The plexiglass window is miraculously intact, but consequently so 
scratched and dirty that one can barely see the slums outside.

   The stench of waste is overpowering in this stuffy apartment. The floor is 
damaged by moisture and the walls are covered with mildew, but both the door 
and the window are intact -- no doubt the reason for the musty, stinking air of 
the place. The word #9TOILET#8 has been helpfully spray-painted on the wall 
across from the door, despite the fact that this room was never actually 
designed to be such a thing.

A Dark, Looted Kitchen~
   Rubble is piled up so high outside the building that nothing can be seen 
through the windows of this kitchen. It is consequently quite dark, and 
lighting up the long, narrow room reveals little as it has clearly been 
plundered in the past. Empty counters and cupboards remain, covered with a 
layer of dust, and empty spaces for a stove and refridgerator suggest that 
someone has even made off with these.

   The internal structure of this building has been ripped out, leaving just a 
shell with four sagging walls. The ceiling overhead bows towards the front of 
the building where the wall has warped, leaving it on the verge of collapse. 
The floor is filthy, covered with dirt and grime, lighter patches just visible 
where rows of shelving used to stand although no furniture or fittings remain 
but for the skeleton of the counter near the door. Wires trail dangerously 
from the ceilings and there's an unpleasant, lingering smell of decay that 
clings to the room.

for the owner. A large titon safe is embedded in the wall behind said counter, 
and the whole place has a general air of painstaking protectivity. 
   Under the safety-glass countertop is a row of gold blocks in different 
carats, all polished and laid out on a piece of cloth.

The Organic Firebreathing Hall (needs firebreather objs/progs and the crate thing)~
   As large as this warehouse is, it still does not quite seem large enough to 
hold everyone that wishes to be within it. A massive crowd of people is 
constantly on the move, clambering for their turn to give the workers their 
organic goods. These workers form three parties: the first are burly men who 
take the offered materials, the second are the men that stand atop the 
Firebreather, mashing the materials down with thick legs and large feet, and 
the last party are the men that pass out the recycled portions, most of whom 
have one or no legs. The first two parties occasionally switch out, the 
stompers getting a much-needed break every now and then. Bodies, carcasses, 
and other assorted organic materials constantly run through this simple 
production line, offering the men no rest as the traffic of the town flows 
constantly around them, unending.

out. Here workers are constantly switched in in alternating shifts, carrying 
crates to and from the Firebreather, feeding the material through its maw. It 
is rather busy and cramped, as business always rages. The air is thick and 
hot.

The Metal Firebreathing Hall (needs firebreather objs/progs and the crate thing)~
   The interior of this large building is never empty - there are always a 
number of people coming and going, a handful more people loitering to carry on 
conversation, and others that just wait silently for their turn. Perpetually 
here are the workers that tend the Firebreather; barrel-chested, burly men that 
collect metal scrap from the townsfolk and feed it into the mechanical monster, 
then divvy out the materials produced. These men are a blend of denizens, 
mutations, and cybernetics, and all are covered in soot. The thick layer of 
ash makes all the men equal - walking black giants with indistinguishable 
features that lug the offered scraps of metal to and fro. The atmosphere that 
surrounds the salvaging activities is somewhat claustrophobic, but everyone 
inside appears to generally be at ease, despite the cramped space that the 
large crowd causes.

The Plastic Firebreathing Hall (needs firebreather objs/progs and the crate thing)~
   While the traffic here is thick, it is not quite as thick as the traffic 
that runs through the other Firebreather buildings. This is, perhaps, owing to 
the haze of black smoke that hangs around inside the building and the chemical 
smell of burning plastic. The smoke and smell come from behind the roped-off 
firebreather, pouring out in thick layers that a large hole in the ceiling 
ultimately fails to ventilate. Around the Firebreather are the Plastic 
Burners, bulky figures covered head-to-toe in thick, black leather, with faces 
obscured by crudely made gas masks. Faceless, these figures march about their 
duties in an organized fashion, offering nothing else in the warehouse any 
attention but the mechanical lizard. Curiously, some of these figures are 
missing a single hand or foot, with nothing but an empty glove or boot covering 
it. If one were to pay enough attention, they would notice gruesome scarring 
beneathe the layers of leather that the Plastic Burner wear - as if their skin 
were melted off the bone and poorly healed. The thick black smoke chokes out 
much of the light, but it is still possible to see through for anyone 
determined enough to stay a while.

The Barroom of Bjork's Boozer~
   Though comfortable enough, this dimly-lit barroom has an underlying tension 
to it. Tables are scattered throughout the locale, and it is clear that 
members of Rust's larger factions prefer to sit with their own and often glower 
pointedly at rival tables. Patrons wander freely in and out of the bar, and 
most are jovial enough by Ruster standards. Spray-painted above an open 
doorway to the south is a plain picture of a toilet. The building itself seems 
incredibly old, made of concrete that has been patched so many times that there 
might not be anything left of the original building material. Coats of chipped 
paint lend some measure of life to the walls, but they are different colours. 
Scratchy music rattles from an old radio somewhere by the bar.

A Dimly-Lit Hallway~
   Just like the commons, this hallway is fairly ancient; the paint on the

the floor is incredibly dull here due to the heavy traffic coming in and out of 
the kitchen door to the south. Signs are set above the other doors - one is 
that of a stick figure, the other a stick figure with a skirt.

otherwise in decent shape. Three scratched metal sinks line one wall, but only 
one has an intact mirror above it. Three toilet stalls occupy the opposite 
wall parallel with the sinks, with rickety doors and locks that have not worked 
in living memory.

A Filthy Men's Restroom~
   This restroom is a disaster. Generations of careless use and vandalism have 
rendered it barely capable of fulfilling its purpose, and recent visitors have 
clearly improvised with the utilities. A long, tarnished urinal clings 
crookedly to one wall while one lonesome toilet stall remains where there once 
were three. The door to the stall is missing, the plastic walls have been shot 
at several times, and somebody has spray-painted a gigantic phallus on the wall 
above the dented, scratched and thoroughly abused metal toilet itself. Other 
graffiti cover practically every inch of the bare concrete walls, and some of 
the ceiling as well. There are no sinks to be found, nor any mirrors, and the 
floor that was once covered in tiles now has perhaps two score of them left.

The Bullet Firebreathing Hall (needs firebreather objs/progs and the crate thing)~
   The metal panels lining the walls have a layer of soot, scrubbed and 
recoated time and again. Dust filters across the rubberized, dark grey floor, 
scuffed from heavy objects and the tread of traffic across it. The interior of 
this large chamber would fit a number of people, even with the mechanical 
monster taking up the majority of the room. A small metal plate is bolted into 
the wall near the western doorway.

The Happy Clam~
   Music constantly blares from a speaker on the stage which is the main focus 
of the entire room, spotlights highlighting a silver stripper pole set before a 
wall of mirrors. Two smaller stages are set to the right and left but are lit 
only half as bright with a string of chairs arranged along the edge of all 
three performance areas. The rest of the room is cast in dim lighting or near 
darkness where other tables or seating have been placed for customers to view 
the scantly-clothed dancers. A bar runs along one wall, out of the way and 
near the entrance, with a few hundred bottles, empty and filled, lining the 
shelves. There is a constant flow of activity throughout the room with some of 
the dancers disappearing upstairs with paying customers or north to where a 
private viewing area is blocked off.

A Private Den~
   Curtains of thick, black fabric section off padded booths along the walls of 
this den, allowing paying customers to spend some private time with the dancer 
of their choosing. Against the far wall, a small, circular stage has been 
built with only a few comfortable seats circling it, the lighting in the whole 
room soft and atmospheric. The music is quieter here though it can still be 
heard drifting in from the main area of the club to the south and there are 
significantly less patrons.

A Long, Dark Hallway~
   This hallway has been painted entirely black, creating an almost sinister 
feel to the already dark passageway. A single door to the north bears the sign 
'Employees Only' and the only other exit is towards the music-filled room of 
the Happy Clam to the west.

A Grimy Kitchen~
   Grime and dirt have been caked into the very cracks on the cement walls and 
floor of this kitchen. Though the counters and shelves seem to have been 
well-maintained, the rest of the room is in ill-repair with creaky cupboards 
and a small hole in the corner of the western wall, allowing the music of the 
club to be easily heard. There is a dual stove and oven against one wall that 
seems to have been rarely used but beside it is a large rack for bottles of 
alcohol. A small door to the north opens up into a pantry while the door to 
the south leads out into the hall.

Doors lead to private rooms save to the north where the hallway continues. 
There is a third floor to the building, but the stairs are gone and that part

A Small Office Above the Private Den~
   This office is extremely bare with only a shelf and a desk for furniture and 
there is absolutely no decor save for the nicks and dents upon the desktop. 
When the wall lamp is lit, it only illuminates the dirt that has accumulated 
over the years between the grayed tiles of the floor. There is a bare window 
on the far wall with a large crack in the glass, the curtain rod gone from its 
hooks.

   The music of the club downstairs vibrates through the dirty, tile floors of 
this small dressing room. Cubbies line one wall with hooks inside bearing 
frilly robes and undergarments while the wall directly opposite the door has 
been turned into a series of make-up stations, mirrors hung above short tables 
covered in bottles of perfume and makeup in a variety of colors and types. A 
series of lightbulbs have been affixed along the top of the stations, casting a 
bright glow around the entire room and the only exit is a thin door to the 
west.

In Front of an Arched, Patchwork Hangar~
   Surrounded by a tall, ill-constructed wall of crumbling polycrete, this yard 
houses a building made entirely of mismatched sheets of assorted metal, 
polyprop and plexiglass, all coaxed into an enormous arch-shaped hangar, the 
front of which has been liberally coated in now peeling red paint. The yard 
itself has been paved after a fashion with cracked faux-stone slabs, one area 
replaced with chipped polycrete and the entire thing is thick with moon dust, 
grime and trash.

Inside an Arched, Patchwork Hangar~
   This space is large, utilitarian and functional. The floor is a grimy, 
poured and uneven polycrete and the walls and ceiling are made up of sheets of 
polyprop and assorted metals all pinned to the industrial looking chrion ribs 
which form an arch high above. Occasional panels of grubby plexiglass form 
windows at irregular windows but most of the light is provided by the long rows 
of lights that are suspended from the roof, bundles of multicoloured wires 
coiled around the roof beams. East of here, a second floor has been 
constructed, a rickety looking staircase connecting to the upper level while an 
internal wall divides the space in half.

A Metal Clad Hangar Room~
   Split off from the main hangar, this area is much narrower with doors 
leading off into rooms behind the north and south walls. As a result, it's 
much less draughty although darker too, only one frosted plexiglass panel in 
the end wall functioning as a window. Lights are mounted on the ceiling, power 
cables running in thick, multicoloured bundles overhead, occasionally branching 
out down the flimsy walls to burrow down into holes bored in the chrion tiles 
on the floor.

   This walkway spans the width of the hangar, a railing separating it from the 
drop down to the main bay. A somewhat unsteady staircase has been joined to 
one end, quite clearly salvaged from somewhere else as it doesn't quite fit 
right and there's a slightly awkward distance between the top step and the 
walkway. In the centre, a door provides access to the room that lies to the 
east.

   Set down a step from the room above, this space functions as a shower large 
enough for several people. The cracks in the walls of this room have been 
left, little effort put into turning it into a comfortable space and the murmur 
of wind from outside is frequent and breezy. Mounted on the walls, a number of 
simple shower heads ring the room, a small drain set into the floor beneath 
each one.

Entrance to a Humid Greenhouse~
   Thick plates of plexiglass separate this greenhouse from the outside world, 
plates that would be see-through if it was not for the heavy moisture built 
upon them. The entire room is kept uncomfortably humid, and the sound of 
dripping water leads a constant assault against the ears. Many rows of troughs 
run the length of the greenhouse, filled with thick plants. The room is kept 
fairly hot also, adding to the general discomfort of the small space.

Narrow Staircase Into a Basement~
   Little care has been taken to maintain the interior of this basement. The 
concrete walls are darkened with dirt and moisture, scarred by numerous cracks, 
and even has the occasional bullethole. The air is dank and stuffy, but it is 
also mixed with the scents of food, smoking, and general living. Noises filter 
up from the deeper portions of the basement, and the occasional pipe or cable 
has been taped to the ceiling of the corridor. The door to the west is covered 
in graffiti and next to it is a bioscanner, clearly installed long after the 
place was constructed.

Deep in a Stifling Greenhouse~
   This room is long and narrow, running from north to south, only about a 
dozen feet wide, but almost twice as long. The walls and ceiling of the room 
are made up of well-constructed alion scaffold. The rods of iron alloy cross 
each other at evenly spaced distances, each support neatly welded to the other 
at every junction. Within the large gaps of the scaffolding, large squares of 
thin, translucent green polyprop have been fused to the frame, keeping the room 
safe from the weather outside, while allowing large amounts of sunlight in. 
Bundles of equipment, wires and piping run throughout the greenhouse, all 
helping to support the crops growing within.

In a Long, Spacious Lobby~
This long, open foyer must once have been quite stylish. Efforts
have been made to cling to that, but time has had the upper hand in
bringing forth the wear and tear of the building. The lobby remains
in decent shape, however, and the faded blue paint on the walls
seems frequently renewed. To the west is the sturdy front door while
the foyer continues eastward to a hallway with stairs at the end.
Light fixtures illuminate the place adequately, and textured plastic
has been laid down on the floor.
   You must #6HANDSCAN WEST#8 to leave that way.

   The hallway turns west and south at a right angle, creating ample space for 
the stairway in the northeast corner, as well as minor storage or the presence 
of multiple individuals. The floor is covered in a textured layer of scuffed 
plastic and the walls have been painted a pale blue, clearly one coat atop many 
others of varying colours. To the west is a long lobby and to the south is 
what appears to be a large office filled with tables, and the stairs themselves 
extend upwards more than just one floor.

In a Table-Filled Former Office~
   What used to be a rather large office has since been cleared of its office 
interior and filled with tables and chairs. Eating utensils have been left on 
some of the tables which, together with the smells from the kitchen to the 
west, suggest the purpose of this repurposed room. There is ample space for 
more than three dozen individuals to sit here at once should they wish to, and 
people do indeed come and go quite frequently, most through the doorway to the 
north. The walls are decorated with paintings and memorabilia, a tall hat here 
and an old weapon there, hung between the windows that allow copious light into 
this hall.

   Despite the small size of this kitchen, it has been built roomy and open to 
encourage ventilation. The large window to the street is always open and the 
doorway to the east has no door in it, preventing the kitchen from filling with 
smoke. A counter runs the length of one wall while a sink and stove setup 
takes up the other, and cupboards line the room overhead. The walls are 
whitewashed and stained, and although the floor is tiled, several of them have 
gone missing to reveal the bare concrete underneath.

Second Floor of a Once Stately Building~
   The stairs continue in both directions, leading down to the ground floor or 
up to the third. It is clear from the looks of the place that it was once an 
impressive building, but even a good effort to keep it in decent state has not 
been able to completely mask the age and deterioration of the structure. It 
remains serviceable and has been given an enthusiastic coat of paint here and 
an umpteenth repair there. To the west of the landing is a scratched door 
while the offices to the south seem to have been repurposed into a workshop.

A Large Communal Bathroom~
   Long and rectangular shaped, this room is pretty plain, made of polycrete 
all around. Like the walls, the floor is bland and grey, though has raised 
areas and grooves to allow a better grip. Along one portion of the walls run a 
series of shower heads with knobs, no curtains to be seen. Adjacent and off in 
one corner are several bathroom stalls with toilets and open fronts. Though 
the age of the building is evident, this restroom is kept in reasonable 
condition. At the far end of the facility is a sliding door for an enclosed 
bathing alcove.

Tool-Filled Office-Turned-Workshop~
   This was clearly once a large office for multiple occupants. It remains 
divided by cubicles, the walls of which are heavily stained and worn but mostly 
intact, and the walls are lined with recepacles for tools, plugs for electrical 
appliances, and other assorted workshop interior. The room is well lit and has 
ample space, but the air is thick with the unpleasant smells of burnt plastic 
and tanned leather. The doorways to the west and north are open, the doors 
themselves having been removed, and chatter frequently filters in from the 
hallway.

In a Noisy Machinery Room~
   Much of the buildig's machinery has been situated in this room. They churn, 
grind and rumble with much heat and noise, making the room uncomfortable to be 
in for long. A window to the south overlooks the street below while a doorless 
doorway to the east leads into the adjacent workshop. All along the north wall 
is a lengthy counter with smaller utensils for use with the machines and 
apperatuses that take up most of the rest of the space.

Third Floor of a Once Stately Building~
   Much use and inexpert maintenance has rendered these stairs creaky and a 
little shaky, but they remain intact and lead all the way to the top of the 
building. Here the landing opens up into an angled hallway, both ends 
culminating in doors. The walls are blotched and worn, and the occasional 
loose wire or cracked bit of plaster stand out like wrinkles on the building's 
old visage. A bioscanner has been installed next to the door to the south, 
clearly a more recent addition to the place. 
   You must #6HANDSCAN SOUTH#8 to go that way.

In a Spacious Chamber Filled with Bunks~
   This large, rectangular chamber has been fille to capacity with bunk beds 
and lockers, leaving very little space for anything else. The walls are 
covered in drawings, satchels, and clothes hung up to dry. There is a 
perpetually busy air about the room and it seems never to be empty, but there 
is scarcely room for anything except laying in bed. The floor is heavily 
scuffed and scratched, and though the walls have been given what seems to be a 
hundred coats of faded blue paint, the cracks and dents still peek through to 
reveal the age of the building.

A Shelf-Lined Storage Room~
   Shelves have been hammered up all along the walls of this room, creating 
ample surface space on which to store things. A single overhead light 
illuminates the place, though the shelves and other contents scatter shadows 
all about. A scanning device has been added beside the northern door long 
after the building's creation, and in the western wall is a smaller door with 
the holder for an office plaque that is long gone. 
   You must #6HANDSCAN SOUTH#8 to leave that way.

In a Small, Dimly-Lit Office~
   Located inconveniently behind the storage room, this diminutive office has 
room for little more than a desk and a few chairs. A solitary window lets 
light in from the west, but not very much, and the lamp in the corner adds 
little to the dim atmosphere of this chamber. It has a private, lived-in air, 
and though the inventory is in relatively decent shape, everything is marked by 
wear and tear. The felt carpet, perhaps once green, has gained large grey 
blotches where feet have worn away the surface fabric. Neatly concealed in a 
corner is a fold-out cot allowing the owner to sneak a nap without having a bed 
in the office, something for which there is just no room.

A Hazy, Cluttered Hangout~
   Scattered, mismatched furniture fills this area of the basement, making for 
a hangout spot that might have been cozy in less squalid surroundings. The 
waterdamaged concrete walls have been decorated with spray-painted pictures and 
even the occasional phrase, and some of the floor is covered in pieces of 
patchwork carpeting. The air is a haze of smoke and the place never seems to 
be empty, with people chatting here or eating there and even a few sleeping in 
the furniture or the corners. The area is not very enclosed but has a sort of 
natural border where the furniture ends and the drab basement continues.

Down a Paint-Streaked Corridor~
   Chaotic artworks cover the walls of this narrow corridor, often little more 
than flung streaks of paint. Pipes and wires cross overhead and the floor is 
raw concrete, so darkened by moist and grime as to be nearly black. A solitary 
lightbulb hangs from the ceiling to poorly illuminate the corridor, and it 
comes to an end after about fifteen feet with nothing but a doorway to the left 
with a curtain to concel the room beyond.

Mattress-Strewn Couples' Room~
   The purpose of this room is quite obvious. Mattresses have been scattered 
all over the floor, making the entire room into something like one big bed. 
The walls are liberally decorated with tags and murals of varying degrees of 
lewdness, and the naked lightbulb hanging from the ceiling has been painted a 
faded red, bathing this nest in a soft pink glow. Nothing else is here save 
for the faint scent of sweat and bodies.

A Dingy Manager's Office~
   This small, spartan office seems designed for the manager of whatever 
building used to stand above this basement complex. A small electrical relay 
and a counter for water usage remains on one wall, harrowed by disuse but more 
or less intact. A desk is bolted to the floor and wall, and the drab grey 
walls do nothing to produce the illusion of space or luxury. Streaks of 
moisture creep down the concrete and the floor is darkened by generations of 
ingrained dirt. The door to the west seems sturdy enough and must have been 
replaced more recently.

The Mural Room~
   An impressive mural covers the entire east wall of this room. It seems to 
be the compound work of many artists, depicting something like a cartoon that 
portrays the history of Rust. The other walls are liberally decorated as well, 
but not as formally or skillfully. The room itself does not seem dedicated to 
any specific purpose except for the stairs in the corner that descend further 
underground. Noise drifts in from the west where a gathering of furniture 
forms an open den.

In a Dark, Moist Basement~
   The corridor from the west opens up into a wider cellar. It is untidy and 
poorly lit, the dull polycrete walls stained in places and streaked with 
moisture in others. The scuffed floor is almost black with ingrained dirt and 
crunches faintly underfoot, and a faint echo follows in the wake of every 
sound. North of here is a door while the southern end of the cellar is host to 
what appears to be a workshop. Near the far wall is a hatch in the floor.

In a Haphazard Sleeping Den~
   This messy chamber is evidently a sleeping room, but not a very organized 
one. Mattresses have been scattered all over the floor together with some 
footlockers, and the rest of the floorspace is taken up by boxes, piles of 
clothes and other clutter. The walls are discoloured and there are several 
spray-painted depictions here and there, one of which resembles a cigarette 
with a red X across it. To the south is an old, worn door with no locking 
mechanism. There are no windows in here, but the room is lit by a long, 
flickering ceiling light and there is a ventilation shaft high upon the wall.

Untidy Workshop with Flickering Lights~
   Not much has been done to maintain order in this workshop. Though it 
appears to have most of what belongs in such a place, it has been piled up here 
and there or pushed into boxes at random. A few pieces of larger machinery 
line one wall and a large table occupies the other, and on the walls are 
receptacles and plugs for all manner of tools. There is a faint smell of 
chemicals and burnt plastic here, and the walls bear several sooty marks from 
fire.

In a Graffiti-Covered Stairwell~
   A short spiral of unsteady metal stairs descends from above into this level 
of the underground complex. The dreary polycrete walls are covered in sloppy 
graffiti, very little of which qualifies as more than mere tagging, and the air 
is heavy and damp. A few pipes and wires streak overhead and further down the 
corridor where it opens up into a wider space.

A Waterdamaged Underground Tunnel~
   Dust and dampness burdens the heavy air of this underground tunnel, adding 
to the unpleasant atmosphere of the place. A hatch allows access from above 
via a wall-mounte ladder, and the tunnel itself extends about twelve yards. 
There is a door in both ends, one of which has had a bioscanner installed next 
to it. The walls are dappled with large, dark blotches from water damage, and 
the polycrete has begun to crumble in places. 
   You must #6HANDSCAN SOUTH#8 to go through there.

In a Storage Cellar~
   This room is fairly plain and seems to have been kept in better condition 
than the rest of the basement. Water damage has been repaired and the door is 
reinforced, clearly a more recent addition to the complex. In here, shelves 
line the walls while much of the floor is taken up by crates and bins. It is 
eerily silent in the room, not the slightest echo or muffled sound entering 
from outside, and any noise made in here is subdued by the structure of this 
cellar. 
   You must #6HANDSCAN NORTH#8 to go that way.

A Dim, Squalid Toilet~
   Bland beige tiles are placed on the floor here, though many are cracked or 
missing. The walls are bare concrete, stained and streaked, and there is 
nothing positive to say about this restroom. There are two stalls to one side, 
their battered walls and doors barely holding together, and a sink next to the 
door above which is the outline for a mirror that has gone missing. It smells 
of musty toilet and chemicals in here, and the place is poorly lit by a 
flickering lamp that hangs lopsidedly from the ceiling.

A Scrubby Patch of Land~
   Somehow overlooked as potential building space, this small area of poured 
polycrete stands behind a metal plank fence, a thin strip of land sandwiched 
between the wall of the southern building and the plexiglass structure of the 
condensation-filled greenhouse to the west. The sounds of the surrounding 
streets filter through but it's otherwise peaceful here, the only window that 
seems to overlook this space securely boarded up. Even so, it hasn't escaped 
the ever-pervasive trash that fills Rust, the battered remains of some 
unidentifiable machine dumped in one corner while other litter is scattered 
about.

A Draughty, Utilitarian Bathroom~
   Draughts whisper in through the cracks in the metal and polyprop walls of 
this bathroom and the floor, covered with thick, textured chrion tiles, seems 
slightly uneven and creaks ever so slightly underfoot. Stalls with flimsy 
looking doors line the northern and wall and a long metal trough runs almost 
the full length of the room from east to west, providing space for a decent 
number of people to wash at once. The trough is split in half with taps on 
either side and a series of small strips of mirror are mounted on metal frames 
at around eye level, a few cracked although most remain intact. A bench lines 
the southern wall and further east, a flimsy looking door separates the shower 
area.

The Walkway of a Decrepit Housing Block~
   This walkway looks over the junk-filled courtyard below and provides access 
to the poor excuses for homes in this area. Many of the doors and windows have 
heavy chrion bars, a few have shutters and more still are boarded up entirely. 
Graffiti in all colours marks the walls but entirely fails to lend any cheer to 
this grimy, filthy place.
