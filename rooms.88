EoD Challenge - Combination Lock~
   Completely devoid of anything that could be considered 
decoration, this plain room is enclosed on all sides by stone 
walls, the only apparent exit being a massive, steel-barred door 
fixed with a very large, heavy-duty combination lock. From the 
looks of it, many have attempted to break down the door, but only 
a few nicks and scratches are all there is to show for the 
effort. 
   If you cannot figure out the combination and want to leave, just
type #6leave room#0 and you'll be transported back to the Guest
Lounge.

The Riddler~
   A throne of stone stands alone in this enclosed chamber, 
positioned directly below an archaic three-tiered candle 
chandelier. The dim light provided there casts a shadowy 
silhouette onto the smooth marble floors. A single bright red 
button has been fitted to the arm of the throne. 
   When you are ready, type #6try me#0 to see if you can beat The
Riddler. If you get stuck, type #6leave room#0 to go back to the
guest lounge.
