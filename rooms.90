A Red-Rocked Bluff, Hosting the SBS Atlas~
   This bluff is surrounded by a craggy red-rocked cliff-face. Several dozen 
feet high, white sand powders the surface, bits of debris sprawled across the 
area. These jagged rocks are large, and form a perilous path downhill to a 
vast desert, which seems to have no end from here. The sky high above is 
daunting and just as endless as the desert below, giving the area a sense of 
majestic wonder. Dominating the view to the west and north is the massive 
structure of the SBS Atlas, a beacon of hope for humankind and a great 
accomplishment of centuries past. A landing stair leads up into a translucent 
tunnel connecting to the vessel from here. Atop the overlooking cliff, far off 
in the distance to the northeast, is a white, cylindrical tower, stained and 
aged with dust and sand.

A Wide, Duney Desert~
   Rolling dunes and white sand greets anybody who treks across this desert. 
This desert seems to stretch on for miles and miles as far as the eye can see. 
Jagged rocks are scattered across the sands here, rendering travel difficult 
and precarious. The sky is brilliantly blue against the white backdrop in the 
daylight, without any clouds. To the northeast is a distant cylindrical 
object, shimmering and distorted beyond the dunes. To the south and west, a 
flickering purple wall feels rock solid to the touch, preventing any progress.

A Sandy, Duney Desert~
   Rolling dunes and white sand greets anybody who treks across this desert. 
This desert seems to stretch on for miles and miles as far as the eye can see. 
The sky is brilliantly blue against the white backdrop in the daylight, without 
any clouds. A small outcropping of rocks has been arranged by nature - or 
something else - into a staggered line along a flat strip of desert. To the 
northeast is a cylindrical object, shimmering and distant beyond the dunes.

A Huge, Rocky and Sandy Desert~
   This desert is strangely picturesque in its harsh beauty; its white rolling 
dunes appear to be like perfect symmetrical peaks; and the sand is immaculately 
white. Patches of dull green shrubbery dot the landscape where the ground is 
firm, marking a nearly featureless landscape. The sky is brilliantly blue 
against the white backdrop in the daylight, without any clouds. To the 
northeast is a cylindrical object, shimmering and distant beyond the dunes.

A Wide, White-Sanded Desert~
   The white sand appears to ripple in this expansive desert from the 
sweltering heat, making it difficult to gauge distance. And at night, the 
sharp drop in temperature is enough to cause frost to cling to the sands. The 
sky is brilliantly blue against the white backdrop in the daylight, without any 
clouds. The dunes level out here in brief respite, the sands retreating in a 
curious stetch of hard-packed dirt. To the northeast is a cylindrical object, 
its contour smooth in shape, shimmering and distant beyond the dunes.

An Expansive, Dune-Covered Desert~
   The white sand appears to ripple in this expansive desert from the 
sweltering heat, making it difficult to gauge distance. And at night, the 
sharp drop in temperature is enough to cause frost to cling to the sands, 
making it crunch underfoot. The sky is brilliantly blue against the white 
backdrop in the daylight, without any clouds. The dunes level out here in 
brief respite, the sands retreating in a curious stretch of hard-packed dirt. 
To the west is a cylindrical monolith, its contour smooth in shape, shimmering 
and distant beyond the dunes.

A Rocky, Sand-covered Desert~
   This desert is strangely picturesque in its harsh beauty; its white rolling 
dunes appear to be like perfect symmetrical peaks; and the sand is immaculately 
white, dotted with the occasional red-hued rock here and there that make 
traversing slightly more difficult. The dunes level out here in brief respite, 
the sands retreating in a curious stretch of hard-packed dirt. Just eastward 
as a faintly shimmering wall, seeming solid to the touch. The sky is 
brilliantly blue against the white backdrop in the daylight, without any 
clouds. In the west is a cylindrical tower that looms large against the 
horizon, a great monolith thrusting upward into the sky. It glints dully, 
looking long worn from the harsh elements and caked with dust. Curving from 
the east to the north is a tranluscent purple wall, rock solid to the touch.

   This desert is strangely picturesque in its harsh beauty; its white rolling 
dunes appear to be like perfect symmetrical peaks; and the sand is immaculately 
white. The sky is brilliantly blue against the white backdrop in the daylight, 
without any clouds. What appears to be a gray obelisk has been half-submerged 
by sand here, its stone surface etched with long-faded runes. To the northeast 
is a distant cylindrical object, shimmering and distant beyond the dunes. A 
great canyon cuts right across this desert abruptly, barring any passage north 
and west by a deep, dark chasm.

A Great, Duney Desert~
   Rolling dunes and white sand greets anybody who treks across this desert. 
This desert seems to stretch on for miles and miles as far as the eye can see. 
The sky is brilliantly blue against the white backdrop in the daylight, without 
any clouds. A small outcropping of rocks has been arranged by nature - or 
something else - into a staggered line along a flat strip of desert. To the 
northeast is a cylindrical object, its contour smooth in shape, shimmering and 
distant beyond the dunes.

   Patches of dull green shrubbery dot the landscape where the ground is firm, 
marking a nearly featureless landscape. The landscape is also littered with 
red craggy rocks that peek through the sands, giving feature as easily as the 
shrubbery. With the heat from the sun beating down, the white sand ripples and

is a marked difference, cold where heat was oppressive before, enough that the 
sand crunches with ice. The sky is brilliantly blue against the white backdrop

sudden canyon, barring access. From here, one might spot the ruins of a mile 
long spaceship deep within the canyon, where part of the bluff has collapsed, 
crushing the remains of the vessel. Time and the fierce elements have 
destroyed the structural integrity of the ship, noticeably so from even this 
distance. The inwardly jutting rocks make climbing down into the chasm a 
wreckless - and most likely, deadly endeavour.

Desert Surrounding a Metal Tower~
   The harsh desert has not yet overcome this towering structure that rises 
high above in the white sands. Sky high, its white plated surface has long 
since faded into a dull grey, battered by winds, and sand. The plates are so 
small as to be appear seamless, separated by needle-thin lines. The only 
indication of a gate is a slightly discolored oval plate at the base of the 
tower, thrown slightly ajar by some unknown force.

A Lightly Wooded Area~
   The sand eventually gives way to rocky terrain. Some of the stones are 
still bleached white, but the deeper one presses into this area, the darker the 
shade of the rocks seem to become - until they are an unscarred grey. The 
little patches of shrubbery become radiantly green and healthy blades of long 
grass burst out of little clusters of pebbles. Not far off, the sound of 
running water can be heard. Day or night, this place is a stunning sight.

An Area Dotted With Grass~
   A sharp contrast to the rest of the desert, this place is beautiful, 
regardless of the time of day. Not far off, to the east the sound of running 
water can be heard, as little clusters of rocks fountain out brilliantly green 
blades of grass. Rocks give way to darker, healthier and more smoother rocks, 
and red and white stop being the dominant colors in this area as greens grow 
over here.

A Wooded Area Cut By a Stream~
   Shrubbery, grass, and bushes become trees, albeit small ones, that sway when 
the wind blows, the leaves moist and cold to the touch. The stones darken 
further here as they create a slope, which is filled with the bluest of water. 
The desert can be seen far to the north or west of here, but the endless sands 
are all but forgotten due to the beauty of this place, with a high cliff face 
to the east that opens up and releases water, which falls into a stream that 
cuts through this area and heads for the south into a bigger pool of water. 
The stream itself is large enough to go thigh deep, and is pleasantly cool when 
you step into it.

A Rich, Overgrown Oasis~
   The smaller foliage gives way to large, majestic trees that form an uneven 
circle around this place. While it is not exactly a forest, the trees do form 
a natural barrier; it is not enough to protect from the elements, but does make 
travel beyond impossible. There is a #6large pool of sparkling water#0 here, 
filled by the stream to the north as it lazily washes down a rock face in a 
trickling waterfall. Grass has overtaken this place, its health a testament to 
the water running beneath this section of the biosphere; it covers most of the 
red rock and clay around it. An outcropping of large, wind-worn boulders 
stands defiantly near the eastern end of the pool. The trees nearby that have 
some scarring on the bark, though it does not take away from their natural awe 
and beauty.

The Entrance of a Quaint Adobe Home~
   Dust and sand have spilled in through cracks in this ancient adobe home. 
Once, it is evident that someone - or someones - lived here. Time and age have 
broken down most signs of such now. Old computers and machinery line the 
southern clay wall here, ruined by the elements. Pieces of gnarled wood still 
rest in the fireplace, with ashes born from a time unknown. The ceiling here 
is short, perhaps nine feet at most, and made from the same red clay as the 
rest of this place. A hallway leads deeper into the home to the east, out of 
the spherical main room.

Before a Sealed Door in a Quaint Adobe Home~
   Dust and sand have spilled in through cracks in this ancient adobe home. 
Once, it is evident that someone - or someones - lived here. Time and age have 
broken down most signs of such now. An adobe countertop lies cracked down its 
center on the east side of this room. Sand and dust have ruined what appears 
to have once been a working stove and sink. This area appears to have been a 
functional, but not spectacular kitchen, in some unknown age, a testament to 
the simple nature of whomever lived here. On the north end of the room, a 
thick steel blastdoor is wired to a small electronic lockbox that is somehow 
still operational. Red spraypaint has been used to convey a message upon the 
outside of the blastdoor, #1"forgive us, Johnny - we love you"#0. Likewise, 
something smaller has been carved into the adobe wall just to the left of the 
electronic lockbox.

A Hateful Ruin of Steel Walls~
   Steel walls have protected this room from the elements outside, but not from 
whatever remained within the cold confines of this prison. Splinters of wood 
and bone, fecal matter and bloodstains remain, a reminder of whatever horrors 
may have once occured here. Large, monstrously sharp objects have scratched 
every visible surface of the steel confines, leaving no inch unscathed; yet, 
the walls and blastdoor remain solid, proof that whatever force may have been 
shut up in here was unsuccessful in what appears to be many, many attempts to 
escape.

   A small room formed within the red adobe bunker remains largely untouched by 
the outside elements. However, everything that was once here has been stripped 
down and is now gone. There are no desks or furniture to speak of. On the 
western wall, a thick steel blastdoor lingers; attached to it is a simple 
keycard reader.

An Airy, Plastic-housed Greenhouse~
   The plastic polyprop walls here are set up as shutters, that can be opened 
so that air can be let into the rest of the greenhouse, and closed to protect 
it from the harsh sand-storms that occasionally rage outside. More rows are 
here, each seperated by plastic little fences that keep the crops from growing 
over each other. The ground is soft sand, though firm enough to walk on 
without sinking or leaving obstructive foot prints.

   The entrance of the greenhouse is a rather large area, perhaps the biggest 
room coming in. The ground is covered in deep sand that is walkable on. 
Strewn about are rows upon rows that are seperated by tiny plastic little 
fences. The walls themselves are made of some sort of plastic polyprop, and 
the rest of the desert stretches out on the other side of the wall. Little 
metallic beams are sparse and hold up the ceiling, which is also made of the 
material the walls are.

The Entrance to Ancient Stone Catacombs~
   A thick steel blastdoor to the south gives way to an old tunnel carved from 
smooth red stone. The tunnel is covered in dust, but looks otherwise unmoved 
by the passage of time. Along the wall sit steel wall-sconces, the 
computerized torches in them still burning brightly. The dim firelight does 
some work to chase away the ancient shadows of this place, though the hall 
remains, largely, a dark place. The ceilings disappear above, eaten by the 
shadows there untouched by torchlight. The smooth stone of the floor matches 
that of the walls. A small golden plaque is set into the western wall here, a 
herald of another peoples and another time.

An Old, Stone Hall~
   The stone hall continues here in two directions, north and south. It 
remains consistent in size, the ceilings higher than the light of the constant 
wall-sconces can reach and its width spacious. Shadows dance across the floor, 
moving with the rhythm of the always burning torchlight.

A Large, Well-Lit Room Before a Statue~
   The moldy stone walls and floor lead to a dead end here, the path southward 
ending in a wall of ancient rock. Ever-burning wall-sconces light the way, 
casting an ever-shifting spell of shadows across the room. To the north, the 
corridor opens up in the only other noticeable direction one might travel in. 
The many sconces here bring to life the masterfully sculpted features of a 
great statue dominating the southern end of this room.

vstr A poorly painted mural spreads across the western wall here. The quality of it could be compared to a child's drawing, lacking the detail and realism of a master's hand, but so also lacking the subtly that true skill brings. Four shakily-drawn SBS vessels fly away from a blue and green planet that is being consumed in cartoonish flames. Beneath the mural is a quotation, its scrawl done by a shaky hand: #6"I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones."#0

vstr A small, carefully painted mural sets apart a section of the eastern wall here, depicting a young man sitting atop a thatch roof. He looks into the distance, a green-covered book tucked between his arm and his side. There, beyond him, a snake of dark smoke rises - gray and green and black. From within the smoke, tiny and desperate arms reach out, ghostly white in their hue. The young man watches on, a silent observer, neither remorse nor keen interest recognizable in his eyes. Around the mural, words are wrapped in a spiral quotation:

vstr On the eastern wall, an expansive mural is painted, depicting a mostly blue planet. A large, squid-like creature of many tendrils and unsettling, alien features wraps its black appendages around the sphere. Another creature of the same design flies apart from the first and the planet, somehow both appearing to be some sort of monster - and, simultaneously - a vessel with many smaller alien figures spilling out of it. Above the mural a quote is scrawled, neatly: #1"Battle not with monsters lest ye become a monster; and if you gaze into the abyss, the abyss gazes into you."#0

vstr A simple, artfully drawn mural has been left on the western wall. It depicts a frightened-looking woman with long, brown hair wearing a white dress. She reaches, timidly to touch a long mirror; the reflection showing in the mirror is a twisted version of the same woman, wearing a shorter, black dress and pounding furiously against the invisible plane of another world. Wrapped around this painting is a quotation, posing a question: #6"Through words and deeds, the superior man moves heaven and earth. Must one, then, not be cautious?"#0

A Dark, Ancient Intersection~
   Dust covers the old stone walls as they all bend away from one another, 
creating a four-way intersection here within the catacombs. Light avoids this 
place without any wall-sconces to illuminate it, casting a cold shadow in the 
center of these two intersecting corridors. In each direction, dim flame 
illuminates the way once again.

ending in a wall of ancient rock. Ever-burning wall-sconces light the way, 
casting an ever-shifting spell of shadows across the room. To the south, the 
corridor continues in the only other noticeable direction one might travel in, 
followed by a wooden and metal track that slopes downward with the path that 
way.

A Turn in the Stone Hallway~
   Here, the ancient stone corridor bends southward and eastward, lit by 
wall-sconces that seem to always burn. The ceiling is lost in the darkness far 
above, where the shadows defeat the dim flame-light.

A Metallic Safe Room~
   This room is unlike the rest of the catacombs. Thick, steel walls create a 
black box, with grimy overhead lights casting an ugly yellow glow over the 
entirety of the area. The room has been stripped of any furniture or equipment 
otherwise, leaving it eerily bare. To the south and north, two blastdoors seal 
this room off from other areas of the catacombs.

An Intact, Extravagant Antechamber~
   Surprisingly so, this antechamber looks well-preserved, as though time was 
unable to touch it. Upon closer inspection, obvious effort went into 
preserving the condition as so. All the gilded, white walls are glossy and 
slick to the touch, some sort of transparent filming applied. Master craftsmen 
spent great liberty to decorate this circular antechamber, for the marble 
ceiling is chiseled with various sculptures. Of particular interest, all 
around the circular ceiling is the depiction of a hearty banquet, 
finely-dressed women and men holding up cups in a toast, smiling. Words spiral 
around the ceiling, reading: #6"Life is the finest party of all, and we're only 
at the entrees!"#0 


   A grand marble arch allows passage further into the north.

A Gaudy, Globular Ballroom~
   Gaudy doesn't even begin to capture the extravagance and finery that went 
into this ballroom. The entire perimeter of the circular room has been covered 
in some kind of finery, from crimson-red, golden-lined embroidery to tastefully 
nude statues in majestic poses. The ballroom floor itself looks to be made out 
of some transparent glass, polished to a shine. What's more beautiful is that 
beyond the glass floor, below a gigantic stone sculpture lies just behind it, 
like some kind of museum exhibit. The gigantic stone sculpture depicts a 
banquet table filled with all kinds of food, but only one man stands in the 
centre of the table, holding up a glass. His garb appears to be Victorian, 
wearing a long, embellished coat. He holds up a glass in solemn reverence.

An Ancient Security Bunker~
   The outside adobe walls of this bunker are re-enforced within by solid 
steel, which has done well to keep much of the sand and dust out. The room 
within is a mess, with various piles of broken machinery, computers and other 
scrap heaped in piles. Along the eastern steel wall, a not-so-subtle message 
has been left in blue spraypaint, warning, "#4what you do not know, cannot 
destroy everything that you do know#0."

A Half-Collapsed, Rack-Filled Den~
   This den is a mess of shattered glass, gray duracrete, and toppled racks. 
Any kind of embroidery or decoration has all but decayed with the passage of 
time, leaving it a husk. However, in its heyday, this den was clearly used as 
some kind of winery, as wine racks upon racks line the walls. Miraculously, 
some bottles are still intact, but their labels have long faded. Manuvering 
around here is a precarious task, as half the ceiling appears to have collapsed 
in on itself. Jagged ruggle and broken glass studs the duracrete floor.

   This home has been stripped of all old belongings. Still, the computerized 
temperature systems are working, though not properly. It is extremely humid 
within, and fungus grows from the red stone walls of the adobe structure's 
innards. A hallway leads deeper into the home, while a seperate walk-in closet 
stands on the northern wall.

A Humid, Fungus-Covered Back Room~
   This may have once been a bedroom. Any belongings from its ancient owner 
have been removed, however, leaving this place barren except for the fungus 
that grows in the humid environment. A few scratches mark the walls on the far 
end, suggesting that something large either attempted to claw its way out of 
here, or that perhaps furniture was once hastily moved up against the clay 
surface there.

empty, no sign of anyone having inhabited the place, except for some carvings

they continue down a slope that descends into the murky waters, casting an 
eerie blue light from the depths below. To the north, the corridor continues 
in the only other noticeable direction one might travel in.

Within a Tight Tunnel,  Along a Ladder~
   This ancient stone tunnel burrows downward without an angle. An old, rusty 
ladder is the only means of ascending or descending here. Despite its age and 
poor hue, the ladder is bolted into the stone and appears secure. Above is the 
hatch that leads back up to the surface of Mars. Below is only darkness.

Far Below the Surface of Mars, Before a Ladder and a Door~
   This ancient stone tunnel burrows downward without an angle until it reaches 
this point: stony, dusty floor that stands wide enough for three people to fit 
here. An old, rusty ladder is the only means of ascending here and a simple 
blastdoor lies westward. Despite its age and poor hue, the ladder is bolted

A Nightmarish Laboratory~
   This room is filled with equipment, but none of it is currently working. It 
appears as though, at some point, someone violently trashed this room, 
destroying machinery and equipment. Any tables, cabinets or filing systems 
have been removed from this place. All of this would not be overly strange, 
perhaps, but for the line of unlit cryo-tubes upon the northern wall, each 
cryo-tube holding a form within.

Atop a Ledge, at the Entrance to a Cave~
   This ledge, hidden to the world below through thick tree-top canopy, 
overlooks the majestic oasis and the edge of the desert beyond. Far to the 
north stands a great white tower, rising above an endless sea of sand dunes. 
Here, red rock leads from the ledge to the wide open maw of a cave leading into 
the rockwall to the east.

metallic grate, dulled with time and rust, maybe a little dusty here and there.

mounted on the ceiling that blink a dull red constantly and create twisty 
shadows on the walls from the dangling wires.

grating persists - all business and no ornamentation. It is conspicuously 
empty here, as if anything of worth was stripped. This place is indeed 
abandoned; loose wiring hangs from ajar panels on the ceiling; the walls are 
bare metal, the skeleton of the building; a film of dust clings to every 
surface. The staleness of the air grows in intensity here. Emergency lights 
blink rapidly here, giving the area a red hue.

rust and dusty only at the corners where it meets the walls. A few electrical 
panels have been yanked out of inserts into the walls, leaving behind dangling 
wires that are severed and useless, powerless. A small vent is set just in the 
corner of the ceiling, where the two walls meet.

the door, no visible way to lock or unlock the heavy obstruction. The metal 
grate floor is dulled with age and rust, bearing a line of dust where it meets 
the wall. Inset blinking red emergency lights offer luminescence to the room, 
perhaps in disorienting constant on and off.

An Armored Military Bunker~
   The air here is overwhelmingly stale, and it's not hard to see why - thick 
walls surround this bunker. Computer stations line the walls here, wires 
snaking from them to slots along the floor. They appear untouched, but 
offline. A transparent, secured gun rack takes up the north wall, filled with 
high-tech, gleaming weaponry. The guns have been effectively secured behind a 
bullet-proof transparent glass-like material, making unauthorized access 
impossible. Everything about this area is utilitarian, from the gun-black 
walls to the gray metal flooring. Emergency strobe lights flash incessantly 
here, casting the place in red light.

The Back of an Armored Military Bunker~
   The gun-black walls of this bunker are unrelentingly bare, briefly cast in 
the red glow of emergency lights on and off in constant blink. This appears to 
have been converted into a small sleeping area as well as serving as a 
stationary room room for most activities, set up from basic utilitarian use 
rather than anything approaching comfort. Along the western wall, two pairs of 
'bunk beds' are inset into the wall, totalling four for sleeping purposes. 
Notched in an inset to one side of them is a small toilet, sink, and shower 
head, crafting a tiny and unprotected bathroom though a folded partition can be 
pulled aside to shield sight when this space is in use. There is no apparent 
kitchen, though a counter is inset into the eastern wall, running the length of 
it. The floors are the familiar metal grate.
